INSERT INTO `Articles_article` VALUES (1,'Sparse Representation with Harmonic Wavelets','A simple method, based on harmonic wavelets, is proposed for the decomposition of a suitable signal into a periodic function and a pulse. It will be shown that, under some general conditions, by a simple projection into two disjoint orthogonal space of functions the periodic component of the signal can be separated from the localized part. The proposed algorithm, gives an approximate (scale depending) decomposition and can be used also for an efficient denoising (as shown in the final examples).','[{\"header\": \"Introduction\", \"paragraph\": [\"The sparse representation of signals (see e.g. [15], [16] and references therein) has been considered as a powerful tool for denoising, coding, compression, source separation [4], [10], [14], [17], [22], [23]. The main idea is to decompose a given signal into a linear combination of functions each of which referring to a suitable basis. In other words, the functional space, taken into consideration, is the span of the union of two family of bases. Usually these bases give some redundant systems unless they are orthogonal each other. The functional space will be given as a direct sum of two orthogonal subspaces having as bases the Fourier harmonic functions and the Littlewood Paley functions respectively. Littlewood Paley functions [11], [12], [18], also called harmonic wavelets [5], [6], [7], [19], [20], [21], despite their low decay in time, have been shown to be a good tool for studying processes which are sharply localized in frequency, as it happens in any kind of signal dealing with highly oscillating systems (vibrations). Harmonic wavelets are a family of basis functions, which enjoy many advantages: a) they are analytically defined and band limited; b) their connections coefficients (refinable integrals) can be easily and finitely computed [5] for any moment (any order derivative); c) the real part of the scaling coefficients are the Shannon wavelets and generalizes the corresponding sampling theorem [6]; d) they can be used to easily represent [8], [9] and analyze self-similar (fractal) signals. It has been shown that wavelets can be a good tool for investigating the main features of fractals [1], [2], [3], [13], [14], [23]. On the other hand, harmonic wavelets have a slow decay in time thus raising some doubts on their usefulness (comparing with other families of wavelets having e.g. the compact support). In the following, it will be shown that harmonic wavelets enjoy also the important property of being orthogonal to the Fourier basis. As a consequence it is possible to decompose the union of periodic functions and localized functions into a direct sum of orthogonal spaces, thus obtaining a sparse representation of the space. The orthogonal decomposition of the space will be applied to some examples of denoising. The next step will be to obtain the sparse representation for discrete sets, but this can be approached and achieved by the discrete harmonic wavelet transform [21].\"]}, {\"header\": \"Harmonic Wavelet Basis\", \"paragraph\": [\"The dilated and translated instances of the Littlewood-Paley basis [12], [21] (harmonic wavelts) for the\", \"being \\u03d5 n k (x) and \\u03c8 n k (x) the scaling and wavelet functions respectively with n, k \\u2208 Z Z Z.

Regardless obfuscation methods, a malware must deobfuscate its core code back to clear executable machine code so that malicious portion will be executed. Thus, to analyze the obfuscation pattern before unpacking provide a chance for us to prevent malware from further execution. In this paper, we propose a heuristic detection approach that targets obfuscated windows binary files being loaded into memory prior to execution. We perform a series of static check on binary file\'s PE structure for common traces of a packer or obfuscation, and gauge a binary\'s maliciousness with a simple risk rating mechanism. As a result, a newly created process, if flagged as possibly malicious by the static screening, will be prevented from further execution. This paper explores the foundation of this research, as well as the testing methodology and current results.','[{\"header\": \"INTRODUCTION\", \"paragraph\": [\"In today\'s increasingly interconnected workplace, there is an ever-increasing rate of viruses, malware, and 0-day exploits attacking the frameworks of this interconnectivity. Computer malware, like its biological counterparts, need a host with which to spread. In modern platforms, this requires that the binaries get loaded into memory in order to execute. This can be done in a variety of ways, but the fact remains that the malicious code must be executed thus, it must at some point be loaded into memory.\", \"Outside of an application exploit, most modern primary and secondary infection points occur from the execution of some malicious binary file once loaded into memory. In modern threat landscapes, this malware is either packed, encrypted, or both. The purpose of which is to prevent reverse engineering, and to lengthen the time to (if not completely evade) antivirus detection. However, the methods used by packers and cryptors to prevent reverse engineering, also make them stand out as abnormal often containing non-standard PE format such as non-standard section names, unusually large section sizes that usually contain null bytes, an entry point that resides outside of the code section, and limited imported library functions, etc.\"]}, {\"header\": \"A. Anatomy of a Packer\", \"paragraph\": [\"To better understand normal verses abnormal PE files, we need to understand how a packer works. A packer works by taking an existing application, compressing it, and then wrapping a small unpacking utility around it. Analogous to the Russian nested dolls [1], the outer layer works to unzip the inner executable in memory and transfers execution to it. Figure 1 shows a high-level view of a normal PE file, while Figure 2 shows its packed counterpart. The difference, as seen in Figure 2, is that the packed executable is actually contained within the normal executable. This \'shell\' is simply designed to unpack its payload and transfer execution to it. As stated above, the general purpose of packing is to prevent easy detection by anti-virus vendors. This works because of the inherent way AV products generate signatures. The AV community looks for a unique series of bytes within a given file (usually within the code section, but doesn\'t have to be). Those unique bytes become a signature from which the AV product will identify malicious files. The problem lies in the fact that there is nothing inherently malicious about a packer or unpacking code. Generating a signature based on that code could potentially lead to erroneous false-positives, negating the usefulness of the AV product.\", \"It would be ideal if we can generate a signature on the \\\"packed executable\\\". However, packing an executable (and possibly encrypting it) removes any real ability to determine what is unique that is, what the payload is trying to accomplish. Even when you create a signature for the file, simply changing a flag on the packing can completely change the \\\"contents\\\" and the signature becomes invalid. If polymorphism is involved, it is practically impossible to create any kind of useful signature.\", \"It is for this reason that it becomes vitally important to develop a method where signatures are not truly needed to catch malware. This paper is to discuss a method that uses the simple characteristics of malware vs. normal files to determine the likelihood that the file is itself malicious.\"]}, {\"header\": \"II. RELATED WORK\", \"paragraph\": [\"Obfuscation is a common term referring any method that is capable of transforming original program code into an unreadable or misleading form in hope of concealing the true purpose of code from direct interpretation by a human being. The obfuscation can be applied to binary machine code or high-level program language such as java or javascript embedded in web traffic [7]. Based on different objects and different purposes, either legitimate or malicious, obfuscation techniques vary greatly. In our research, we only address the malicious obfuscation that applied to windows binary code. While some researches focus on deobfuscation of actual obfuscated code in order to reveal true intent of that piece of code [8][12], we care about the detection of malicious obfuscation, and we do it by examining the overall suspicious patterns in Windows PE structures rather than deobfuscation.\", \"Based on where the detection happens, either before the code gets loaded into the memory or after, the detection approach can be categorized into static vs. dynamic strategies. The dynamic strategies require the code to run first in a virtualized environment or Sandbox in order to be identified by its actual behavior [13][14]. Deobfuscation or unpacking through a debugger is commonly used for manually tracking behaviors of the code [15] [16], and the code itself is not necessarily obfuscated. Our research primarily focuses on the static approach of malicious obfuscation detection.\", \"Mandiant s Red Curtain [6][11] is a recent research product that similar in concept to what we focus on, with a straightforward approach to deal with obfuscation. Red Curtain conducts static analysis on the windows PE structure for the presence of obfuscation. It first calculates the Entropy value against the content from each section: .idata, .text, etc. and then compares the Entropy value with a threshold to determine if this section has been obfuscated since the Entropy value is to measure the randomness, and obfuscated code would appear to be more random than otherwise.\", \"Other related static methods [9][10] detect malicious obfuscated code by comparing a list of extracted system calls with those made by known, malicious code under the hypotheses that many malwares are simply twisted versions that share same features of the original one [9]. That method requires obtaining a signature set of identified malicious system calls before further detection. The advantage there is that it can detect the polymorphic or metamorphic malware. In [10], no explicit signatures are generated and a semantic analysis framework is applied to identify malware\'s behavior. This method is a general approach focusing on program language aspect analysis and not on analysis from windows PE structure aspect.\", \"The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 3 describes various packer analysis checkpoints; Section 4 presents the implementation risk score mechanism that used to calculate the final risk score; Section 5 reports the experiment result; and Section 6 provides conclusion as well as some possible future work.\"]}, {\"header\": \"III. ANALYSIS ON PACKING TECHNIQUE\", \"paragraph\": [\"From the background discussion, we know that the growing trend in malware is to utilize packers/cryptors to \\\"hide\\\" the true intent of an executable. However, the method of hiding also leaves certain observable characteristics that can help us identify potentially harmful files -without the need for signatures or virus definitions. To do this, we employ a risk model on the observable characteristics under static analysis of a given file.\", \"In order to provide the static risk analysis of a binary file, we must first identify the characteristics (observable) that are most likely to change with malware. As discussed in section 1, we will look at the section names, import functions count, and entry point location; as well as DLL characteristics, TLS inclusion, import ordinal values and other PE format characteristics for abnormalities.\"]}, {\"header\": \"A. Non-Standard Section Names\", \"paragraph\": [\"Microsoft has published [2] a set of standards and baselines for use by developers for the creation of PE and COFF file formats under the Windows family of operating systems. These are the default characteristics that are upheld by compilers that create the specified files. A very important thing to note is that not all compilers that create Windows binary files behave the same. While GCC and Visual Studio may use .text to label the code section, Borland may use .code.\", \"Regardless, compilers have documented standard names which they use to describe the sections they create (see Figure 1). While compilers do give the developers the ability to create their own section names using special flags in their code -it is not often enough to deviate from a baseline standard. An exception to this is in the case of malware. Most of today\'s common packer/cryptor in use creates new section names so that the unpacking code can recognize the pieces to actually unpack. No observed obfuscated malware known to this author uses, in their entirety, standardized section names. We use this fact as a characteristic to flag on.\", \"One further note about each section is that the compiler defines characteristics for each defined section. This aids the loader in being able to mark the allocated memory sections and set the behavior that is expected for each section. For example, your code section is marked executable as this is where the actual execution is to take place; but the section that contains the variable information is not. We also check the section\'s against their documented characteristics. This is to ensure that the malware writers have not modified standardized sections for other purposes.\"]}, {\"header\": \"B. Flagged Section Names\", \"paragraph\": [\"To further the section analysis, there are also some fairly standardized section names that are used by packers and cryptors. While these can be changed, it has been observed that most are not. We use this observation to further determine the potential for malicious characteristics. Examples of flagged section names are .UPX and .aspack just to name a couple.\"]}, {\"header\": \"C. Entry-Point resides outside code section\", \"paragraph\": [\"Earlier, we discussed that one of the main purposes for packers and cryptors is the authors desire to obfuscate what the contents of the file are -thus hiding the malware\'s intent. One way to accomplish this is to obfuscate the entry point of the program. The entry point is the address where the loader passes execution to the application. This address is defined in the header of the PE file as can be seen in Figure 3. This address, given in hexadecimal, is an offset from the Image Base address. From Figure 3, we can get the entry point of this executable by the following: Image Base + Address of Entry Point. In this example the entry point would be at address 0x00402C7B. The next step is to find what section this entry point falls into.\", \"The reason we do this is that some malware, such as file appendors, will modify this address to point to a non code section. Specifically, it will point outside the .text section -marked as code. In this example however, we see that the entry point falls within the range between the Virtual Address and Virtual Size, thus resides within the code and executable section (see Figure 4). This type of check is useful for packed and encrypted files; but is key among pre-and post-file appendors. A check can easily be done in the call and control flow graphs to determine if any execution can pass outside the code and executables sections as well.\"]}, {\"header\": \"D. Thread Local Storage (TLS) Section Check\", \"paragraph\": [\"Given the above discussion regarding the entry-point of executables, one exception is that of the Thread Local Storage entry point. Since the days of Windows NT, Microsoft has provided a mechanism that allows multithreaded applications the ability to provide functions and separate storage for thread-specific needs. This includes the ability to execute functions for initialization. Before the Windows loader transfers execution to the main entry point, it first looks for a TLS data directory defined in the PE header [3]. If one is defined, it will perform the functions defined within this directory first.\", \"This undocumented feature will be executed anytime a thread is created or destroyed.\", \"Since running an executable is essentially creating a thread (main thread of execution) to execute the program, the loader interprets this as a thread creation and executes the code in the TLS section assuming the need for thread initialization. Figure 5 shows the TLS entry in the Data Directory. One thing to note about this directory entry is that the loader will only attempt to execute it if the Virtual Address does not equal to 0. A check of the size is not actually done regardless if the Virtual Address is defined.\"]}, {\"header\": \"E. Dynamically-Linked Library (DLL) with no Exports\", \"paragraph\": [\"Dynamically-Linked Libraries are, by their definition, a file that contains a library of functions. They provide functions to calling applications to promote the write-onceuse-many philosophy. DLL\'s typically allow for more than one application to use them at a time. By this very definition, DLL files should be exporting at least one function to be used by applications. DLL\'s are structured similar to standard EXE files in that they contain a Main function (DLLMain) for initialization purposes. Whenever a DLL gets loaded, this function is called to help initialize the DLL. Microsoft also provides a mechanism that treats DLL files in a similar manner to EXE\'s; this application is called rundll32.exe. This application will allow someone to execute an exported function from a DLL from the command-line. Attackers can utilize this to simply create a DLL with no exports and the default MAIN entry-point. Using rundll32 and passing it the name of your DLL will cause the DLL to be executed in a similar fashion to an EXE.\", \"Knowing this, we look for any DLL files that are being loaded that contain no actual exports. While it is possible to be legitimate, we will flag this as suspicious for further analysis.\"]}, {\"header\": \"F. Low Import Function Count\", \"paragraph\": [\"It has been well documented that modern malware packs/encrypts itself to help obfuscate its real intention. Part of this behavior includes hiding the actual functions needed by the obfuscated program, or more likely, that the packer simply packs them up as well -only requiring the needed functions to perform the unpacking. Most good packers require only 2 functions to successfully unpack a file -LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress. This allows them to call any library and function, at will, as they need them. This further helps to obfuscate what the unpacker is doing as well! To give you a better idea -take the following simple \'Hello World!\' program: int main(int argc, char **argv) { printf(\\\"Hello World!\\\\n\\\"); return 0; } When this is compiled with MS Visual Studio, it contains over 30 imported functions; and I am only actually calling 1! Utilizing this knowledge, we do a check on the number of imported functions a file has. If it falls at or below a defined threshold, it is flagged as suspicious.\"]}, {\"header\": \"G. Import Function Table Check\", \"paragraph\": [\"Most packers and cryptors do not need to care about the import table of a PE file because their sole job is to simply unpack the packed file(s). And for this, libraries are not needed. All modern packers are quite poorly written in that they do not create baseline adhered PE headers. The Windows loader only truly needs a few entries of the header file to run properly -the import table is one of them. In this case, most packers will mangle the import table of the packed file to save from having to properly align and reconstruct the table itself.\", \"For an unpacked PE file, it will have its import table filled with either the import API names or the ordinal value of the APIs within that import DLL. Whether import table array will point to an API name or ordinal value depends on if delayed loading on imported APIs is required. C In most cases when a delayed loading is not involved for an API, IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME structure will be used to describe the API. IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME structure contains two fields: Hint and the API\'s name. For a packed PE file, it has been observed that it has a higher chance to have zero hint values along with non-empty API names comparing to an unpacked PE file. On the other hand, if a delayed loading is involved for an API, the IMAGE_THUNK_DATA will simply point to an ordinal value instead of IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME structure. Ordinal values are values that are used to find import functions within a DLL. This aids the Windows loader to find the proper function in memory and resolve the address of it to Import function table of an application in the case of delayed loading. It has been observed that packed files rarely have delayed loading for its API.\", \"Based on the above observation, we check every function (if they exist) in the import table for their hint values if no delayed loading involved, a \'0000\' hint value would have a higher probability indicating a suspicious file containing a malformed import table. On the other hand, we check the \'0\' ordinal value to see if it corresponds with delayed loading.\", \"A legitimate file with properly constructed import table should have non-zero ordinal value for its delayed loading API, we flag on zero ordinal value for those files that use delayed loadings.\"]}, {\"header\": \"IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND RISK CLASSIFICATION\", \"paragraph\": [\"We have implemented the risk structure outlined above as a DLL file that operates over X86 Microsoft Windows platforms -processing each file loaded by certain process calls within the windows loading API mechanism. Our implementation first does the static analysis against a Windows PE file and generates a risk score. If the risk score is below a triggering threshold, this PE file is loaded into the memory silently as usual. If the risk score is above the triggering threshold, a popup window will be prompted to users requiring further actions.\", \"We utilized a risk analysis matrix and compiled a riskscore to determine the probability of maliciousness for any file under analysis. The formula to calculate risks starts by using a simple weighted means across the characteristics under observation:\", \"Where w i and r i are weight and risk score associated with characteristic i. R is the overall risk score of a binary file. Currently we check totally 8 characteristics for suspiciousness. Each checked characteristic is assigned with a weight and a risk score. The risk score r i indicates how risky the characteristic i is if found in the binary file. We assign a predefined risk score for each of 8 characteristics based on our experience and the comparison between malware and legitimate system files.\", \"The characteristics\' weight is reversely proportional to the frequency of those 8 characteristics shown by normal non-packed system files. Since normal system files are expected to be exempt from all of those above 8 characteristics, the characteristic that has higher frequency/possibility to be contained in normal files has less weight in deciding the final risk score. We use clean windows system files under Windows system folder to check out the presence of above characteristics. The following weight present in tables is the result after running through a typical setting of our windows XP system with 2014 windows systems files.\", \"In all, the risk score and weight we used in evaluating the likelihood of obfuscated malware are as shown in Table 1.  On the malware side, for the preliminary 144 confirmed malware samples we collected, 65 of them are packed with known packers, and 79 of them are either packed with unknown packers or unpacked. The complete detection rate with different risk score thresholds are shown in Table 3. We use the signature set from PeiD [4] for packer identification. Among all 65 confirmed packed malware samples, we obtain 89.2% or higher detection rate with risk threshold of 3. Among all 144 malware samples, we flagged 84 suspicious files (58.3% detection rate) with threshold of 3, which is a reasonable result for us since our detection tool only targeted obfuscated malwares rather than unobfuscated ones. We have detailed risk score output for all malware in the appendix section. Roughly speaking, if we use a threshold of 1, then we will have 95.3% detection rate, but 3.94% false positive rate. If we use a threshold of 3, then we will have 89% detection rate and 1.6% false positive rate.\", \"Other than the test on a relatively small amount of confirmed malware samples, we regularly collect potential malware samples through various means. We track downloads in the real environment, and record the antivirus detection results as well as our detection result, a snapshot of this is shown in Figure 6. Our tool is able to detect obfuscated virus with a much higher accuracy when compared with an AV product such as Symantec. The signature based detection strategy is less efficient whenfacing obfuscated malware files.\"]}, {\"header\": \"VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\", \"paragraph\": [\"Malware obfuscation has cause great difficulty for signature-based anti-virus product.

INTRODUCTION\", \"paragraph\": [\"In this paper, the challenging problem of intrusion detection using PIR sensors in the presence of clutter arising from windblown vegetation is addressed [1]. Manufacturers recommend careful placement of their PIR detectors to prevent false alarms resulting from vegetation, air currents, etc [2]. In [3], [4] and [5], the PIR signal is first high-pass filtered to remove the low frequency components resulting from slow environment changes and then the signal energy is compared against an adaptive threshold. In particular, they use an unsupervised adaptation technique to adjust the energy threshold for target detection. Most other works either use simple thresholding on the PIR signal or thresholding on the energy computed in a window in declaring a detection. In the current paper, we present a low-complexity SVM-training based algorithm that uses the HT to separate intruder from clutter. We believe that training of the form, inherent in SVM, should form an essential part of any solution, given the large variations in intruder and clutter signatures possible. Also SVM makes possible a more fine-grain frequency-domain approach to separating intruder from clutter. The PIR sensor under study in this paper is the analog Panasonic Motion Sensor AM N 24111. But our results can readily be extended to other sensors. Training and testing were carried out on actual experimental data and the algorithm was found to exhibit good performance. The lowcomplexity nature of the algorithm serves to achieve a key objective in WSN, namely the extension of network lifetime. Also contained in the paper is a closed-form expression for the signal generated by an intruder moving at constant velocity. It is shown how this expression can be exploited to determine the direction of motion and the velocity of the intruder from the signals of three well-positioned sensors.\"]}, {\"header\": \"II.

Choice of the Sensor\", \"paragraph\": [\"We were initially faced with a choice between the Digital Panasonic Motion Sensor AM N 14121 and the analog sensor mentioned above. We preferred the analog sensor to the digital PIR sensor as it was easier to distinguish between the spectrum of intruder and clutter from the output of the analog sensor (see Fig. 1).\"]}, {\"header\": \"B. Overview of the Algorithm\", \"paragraph\": [\"For the purpose of maximizing battery life, it was decided to use HT for computing the spectrum of intruder and clutter signals in preference to the computationally more complex Discrete Fourier Transform as only additions and subtractions suffice to compute the HT. An alternative would have been to use Walsh Hadamard Transform (WHT) but HT was preferred as it is less complex compared to WHT, it has ability to reuse past computed HT coefficients for the next window and can potentially be used to yield time-frequency localization information. A sampling frequency (f s ) of 12.5Hz was chosen based on the frequency content of intruder and clutter waveforms (see Fig. 1). A functional block diagram of the algorithm appears in Fig. 2. A block of 128 (N ) consecutive samples is transformed by HT. The energy in each of these transformed components are binned into 8 frequency bins. The resultant binned vector is passed on to a classifier (obtained by offline SVM training) which classifies it as either intruder or clutter. This entire process is repeated every 16 (L) samples.\"]}, {\"header\": \"C. The Haar Transform and Frequency Binning\", \"paragraph\": [\"Since the Haar transform is wavelet based, coefficients are designed to provide both frequency and time localization information. As a result, the breakdown of 128 Haar coefficients is as follows: there is one coefficient assigned to frequency 0 (the DC component) and 2 k coefficients attached to signals of frequency 2 k , 0 \\u2264 k \\u2264 6. Thus, there are a total of log(N ) + 1 = 8 frequencies in all and in our algorithm, we collect together the energy in each of these 8 frequency \\\"bins\\\". The Haar signals associated with an example N = 8sample transform are shown in Fig. 3. The time localization information allows reuse of most of the components of the last transformed vector for the current window if there is overlap of the current window with the previous window.\"]}, {\"header\": \"D. Support Vector Machine\", \"paragraph\": [\"SVM is a machine-learning technique used for classification which when input with two labeled sets of data (here binned vectors) returns a decision surface which tends to maximize the margin between the two data sets [6]. Under linear SVM, the decision surface is chosen by SVM to be the hyperplane in the input space that maximizes the margin, i.e., that maximizes the distance between the hyperplane and the input data sets. In our case, the input space is 8 dimensional. The optimal hyperplane is typically found in practice by reformulating it as a quadratic programming optimization problem which can be efficiently solved. If the input data in linear SVM are not separable by a hyperplane, we allow training errors to occur. The tradeoff between the margin and the training errors can be controlled by a parameter C in SVM. The larger the value of C, the lesser the number of training errors leading to a smaller margin. An alternative means of handling training errors is to use a nonlinear separating surface. In quadratic SVM, the optimal decision surface is chosen to be the hyperplane in a larger dimension space which maximizes the margin from points in the larger dimension space to which points in the data set are mapped. Each coordinate in the larger dimension space is associated to a unique monomial of degree 1 or 2 in the variables attached to the input space. Thus the larger space is of dimension 8 2 +8+8=44. It is to be noted that there is a risk of over-fitting the data with a high degree separating surface that will perfectly separate the training data but it is likely to fail on any new data (see Fig. 4).\"]}, {\"header\": \"E. Computational Complexity\", \"paragraph\": [\"Since training of the SVM was done offline, in estimating the computational complexity, we consider only the computations carried out online in the mote on the incoming data. We consider linear SVM classifiers initially and quadratic SVM classifiers subsequently. SVM classification involves calculating \\u03b3=w T x + b where w is the normal to the hyperplane, b represents the affine shift of the hyperplane and x is the binned vector. Thus \\u03b3 is proportional to the distance of x to the hyperplane. The number of computations required for the online part of the algorithm for both linear and quadratic SVM appears in Fig. 5. It is to be noted that the computations are in the order of input size \'N\'.\"]}, {\"header\": \"F. Training and Testing\", \"paragraph\": [\"The data used for training SVM was collected in a laboratory (i.e., clutter-free) environment (see Fig. 6) in the case of intruder and across 20 outdoor locations on the forested campus of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) (see Fig. 7) in the case of clutter. The training data set for intruder includes data collected from making a human walk along different straight lines oriented in a variety of ways w.r.t. the sensor. The clutter data was accumulated over the 6-month period from October 2008 to March 2009. This would involve setting down many nodes on the ground in selected clutter-prone areas and letting them observe and record data. The data streams collected were partitioned into two sets, one used for training, the other for testing. The data streams from some of the more challenging environments (for example, a sensor placed in the close proximity of large fern, or an intruder moving with high velocity) was used for training. From the data streams to be used for training, a total of 224 blocks were extracted, 112 each representing intruder and clutter. Each block is a vector containing 128 consecutive time samples. The offline training of SVM was done using LIBSVM [7] in MATLAB. Linear SVM, with C set a high value, was used.\", \"The training performance recorded 7/112 = 6.3% misses and 4/112 = 3.6% false alarms. It should be noted that the training set deliberately includes some data that was hard to classify. Not surprisingly, testing performance was significantly better than training performance. The testing performance recorded 3/500 = 0.5% misses and 2000/160000 = 1.25% false alarms. Some representative samples appear in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. Fig. 8 shows four intrusions when the intruder sprinted four times in front of the sensor over a period of 70 seconds, all of which are successfully detected by the algorithm. Fig. 9 shows clutter data collected over a period of 80 seconds, the clutter was successfully rejected.\"]}, {\"header\": \"G. Limitations and Future Work\", \"paragraph\": [\"As mentioned, the data reported above was for the period October 2008 to March 2009. However, when we carried out testing around noontime in April 2009, at the height of the summer in Bangalore, we observed a significantly larger false alarm rate. Fig. 10 shows a sample waveform recorded in this period. When such summer noontime data was also included in the training set, linear SVM recorded a training performance of 60/275 = 21.8% misses and 22/275 = 8% false alarms. Testing performance recorded 30/300 = 10% misses and 6100/100000 = 6.1% false alarms. Replacing the linear SVM with a quadratic SVM, was able to improve the record on training data to 47/275 = 17% misses and 15/275 = 5.5% false alarms. The improvement with regard to testing data was far more pronounced. We feel that the use of multiple sensors would permit reduction of the false alarm rate since the false alarms were often caused by the movement of vegetation in close proximity to a sensor. An alternative approach would be to detect intruders based on a better understanding of the signature waveform of the intruder and clutter. The next section provides some analysis in this direction. A closed-form expression for a good approximation to the intruder waveform is provided and it is shown how this can be used to determine how to optimally place multiple sensors so as to estimate the path of a human being in motion.\"]}, {\"header\": \"III. ANALYTICAL MODEL FOR INTRUDER SIGNATURE\", \"paragraph\": [\"The Panasonic PIR sensor has a quad of sensing elements and a multilens which creates a virtual pixel array (VPA) [8] in its field of vision. When an intruder cuts across the virtual beams, the infra-red signal incident on the sensing element can be modeled as a triangular waveform whose period is inversely proportional to the angular velocity \\u03c9 of the intruder [9]. The sensing element acts upon this infrared signal as a band-pass filter which we will assume filters out all but the fundamental frequency component, whose frequency is thus proportional to \\u03c9. Let \\u03ba denote the proportionality constant. The intruder is assumed to walk with a uniform velocity along a straight line path in the vicinity of the sensor. This is a reasonable assumption as the sensing range of the sensor is around 6m. Let v be the speed of the intruder walking along a straight line making an angle \\u03c6 with the sensor\'s axis and at a distance of d from the sensor (see Fig. 11). Let 2\\u03b8 be the horizontal angular coverage of the sensor equal to 110 \\u2022 in for the sensor under study. The sensor responds to the intrusion for t > 0. The duration of the signal is limited either by the sensing range or by the angular coverage of the sensor. The instantaneous frequency f (t) of the intruder signature from OBC is given by,\", \"Using OAB we can substitute for r(t) to get\", \"and cot(\\u03c6 + \\u03b8) = -\\u03bbt 0 .

We can now rewrite (1) as Note that the maximum frequency f max = \\u03ba\\u03bb occurs at t 0 = -cot(\\u03c6+\\u03b8) \\u03bb\", \". The intruder signature is thus given by,\"]}, {\"header\": \"A. Observations made from the Model\", \"paragraph\": [\"The constant \\u03ba corresponds to the density of the beams in the plane of the intruder motion. Hence the analytical expression naturally extends to other differential PIR sensors in general as \\u03ba abstracts the lens. \\u03bb and t 0 determine the intruder\'s analytical waveform. \\u03bb contains all the information required to track the intruder but \\u03bb for different triplets of (v, d, \\u03c6) can be the same. So to track the intruder, many sensor nodes spaced apart will be required.\"]}, {\"header\": \"IV. TRACKING\", \"paragraph\": [\"The goal in this section is to determine an optimal locationing of multiple sensor nodes, having coordinates (x i , y i ) respectively, that will enable them to reliably estimate the velocity and direction of motion of the intruder.

We assume on the basis of (3) that the ith sensor node reliably estimates \\u03b7 i . where d min,i is the distance from the i th node to the straight-line path of the intruder.

Without loss of generality, we assume a coordinate system whose origin is equidistant from the three sensors. Thus we may assume that each sensor is at a constant distance R from the origin.

This suggests that the nodes should be arranged in an equilateral triangle with R as large as possible, subject to the desired node density.\", \"V. FIELD TESTING Field testing was conducted on the lawns of Electrical Communication Engineering (ECE) Department in IISc campus. In the field tests, three sensors were mounted onto a single node each with an angular spacing of 120 \\u2022 . When combined with the approximately 110 \\u2022 angular field of view of each sensor, this essentially gave each node an omni-directional sensing range (see Fig. 14). Data emanating from the 3 sensors were fed to the 3 ADC channels of the TelosB motes. The initial decision was to deploy the sensor nodes in the form of a linear array with inter-node spacing chosen to maximize the area covered by a single node while ensuring that every point in the sensing range was covered by at least 3 nodes. The idea here was that the sensing nodes would serve as a wireless trip wire (see Fig. 14). Larger areas can be covered by interlacing many such wireless trip wires. It was found that a single linear array would on occasion, fail to detect intruder moving at highspeeds, possibly because at high speeds, the intruder was in the field of view for only a very short duration. With this in mind, the decision was made to create a double array comprising of two identical, linear and parallel arrays spaced apart by 5m (which is just 1m under the maximum sensing radius of 6m). Decisions were made locally as follows: If a node detected an intruder in its vicinity using the HT-cum-SVM based algorithm outlined earlier, it would broadcast its local detection (via the Zigbee protocol available on TelosB motes) to all of its neighbors. A node was permitted to declare a confirmed detection if in addition to making a local detection, it also received news of local detection from any other node within a distance of twice the sensing range of each sensor. The confirmed detection was then relayed back to the base station using an appropriately designed network routing algorithm. At the base station, a graphical user interface (GUI) would display the information regarding the nodes that detected and the route of the confirmed detection. This algorithm is scalable as the detection of an intruder results from the consensus of a few neighboring nodes. When tested over a period of several hours across the week, the network performed flawlessly by detecting every intrusion at speeds ranging from that of a slow crawl to a sprint at 5m/sec. There were also no false alarms in the period over which testing was conducted.\"]}, {\"header\": \"ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\", \"paragraph\": [\"We would like to thank several people for their support and encouragement: Professors V.

INTRODUCTION\", \"paragraph\": [\"In this work, we target the problem of effective crowd data sourcing, namely gathering data from the crowd in an economical and principled fashion. Specifically, we present AskIt! , a system that allows interactive data sourcing applications to effectively determine which questions should be directed to which users in order to minimize the uncertainty about the collected data. This is essential in a variety of applications, as illustrated by the following three examples.\", \"Consider an online marketplace where customers can rate the sellers from whom they purchased goods. (A concrete example is Amazon\'s service at http://www.amazon.com/gp/ seller/sell-your-stuff.html .) Clearly, all parties can benefit from having representative ratings for every seller. But since dissatisfied customers are more likely to voluntarily provide their ratings, the obtained distribution of ratings for a given seller may be skewed, and hence there is a strong incentive to contact customers and explicitly request ratings for their recent transactions. In this example, the crowd comprises the customers, the data (and correspondingly the questions for customers) comprises the sellers\' ratings, and the problem is to understand which customers to contact in order to maximize the information gain from the obtained user answers. As another example, consider an image-tagging service such as tagasauris (http://www.tagasauris.com/). In this scenario, the crowd comprises paid workers, the data (and corresponding questions) comprises the tags associated with images in a specific corpus, and the goal is to intelligently assign images to workers for tagging. The underlying optimization problem is similar to the above but in addition every request to the crowd involves a monetary reward. Hence, it may be desirable to select only a limited number of the most useful requests based on a total monetary budget. Finally, one more example is the GUESS system from IBM Research, which engages users in a Trivia-like game and uses their answers for Trivia questions to maintain and curate a knowledge base. The nature of the game introduces an interesting constraint: each user typically plays only for a limited time hence cannot be asked too many questions. This further complicates the optimization problem.\", \"The above examples involve an optimization across several dimensions. First, not all customers are equal: in the sellers rating example, each customer can provide ratings solely for the sellers with whom there was a transaction; different customers may be more or less likely to provide ratings; and, there may be constraints on how often a customer can be contacted (e.g., a customer may be more likely to reply to a rating request if they are not contacted too often). Second, not all questions/answers (ratings in this example) are equal. As a simplified example, assume that each seller is rated as either \\\"GOOD\\\" or \\\"BAD\\\", and consider two sellers A and B with the following ratings: seller A has three \\\"GOOD\\\" ratings and one \\\"BAD\\\" rating, whereas seller B has two \\\"GOOD\\\" ratings and two \\\"BAD\\\" ratings. One more rating for seller B cannot shift the overall distribution much, whereas one more rating for A can make a larger difference (it will lead to either a 4/1 split, i.e., strong positive majority, or a 3/2 split, i.e., almost equal split of opinions). In this sense, an additional rating for A is more beneficial. Overall, these observations reveal a complex optimization problem that is not likely to be solved effectively by requesting ratings at random.\", \"To address and solve the above issues, we developed AskIt! , a real time system that carefully selects which questions to ask in order to reduce the uncertainty of the current data and also minimize the number of probes (questions) at different users. The optimization problems handled by AskIt! address a wide range of real-world applications in our target domain (including the three examples mentioned above). It is intuitively formalized as follows. We consider a universe U of users (the crowd) and a universe Q of questions. The information that is gathered from the crowd is represented by a |U | \\u00d7 |Q| matrix M , where an entry M [u, q] contains the answer of user u to question q or the special value \\u2205 if u has not answered q. For instance, in the seller ratings application, q represents a seller, u represents a customer and M [u, q] is the rating given by u to q (or \\u2205 if u has not rated q). Hence, asking the crowd for data means resolving some of the \\u2205 cells to concrete values. We develop a metric (described in the following section) to characterize the quality of the information in M based on the uncertainty caused by \\u2205 cells. Uncertainty as we define it can only decrease as more \\u2205 cells are resolved, and the decrease depends on the choice of which cells are resolved. (This is in accordance to the example we presented earlier with the two sellers A and B.) Using this foundation, we can formalize the optimization problem as follows: Given M and a set of constraints on which \\u2205 cells can be selected, identify the cells that satisfy the constraints and provide the highest reduction in uncertainty.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Outline of the demonstration:\", \"paragraph\": [\"We demonstrate the problem described above along with our solution in the context of a multiple-choice question game played by the ICDE\'12 attendees.

To make the game more entertaining and whimsical (and thereby motivate users to participate in our demo), AskIt! will also ask questions about humorous characteristics of the conference attendees, such as which celebrity they resemble or how funny they are. Participating players will then be allowed to view the crowd\'s answers about themselves and their colleagues, but only after they themselves answer a minimal set of questions.\"]}, {\"header\": \"II. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND\", \"paragraph\": [\"We start with a formal statement of the optimization problem solved by AskIt! and a brief description of the principles underlying the algorithms used to solve it, and then consider some practical aspects regarding the input data (users, questions and answers).\", \"Problem statement and algorithms: We are given a set of users U and a set of questions Q.

For simplicity, we henceforth assume that A q = A = {a 1 , . . . , a n } for all q \\u2208 Q, i.e., all questions have answers in the same domain. We will use (u, q) and c interchangeably to denote a cell in the matrix.\", \"We use a measure of entropy to quantify the uncertainty in the current answers of some question q. Formally, let p 1 , . . . , p n denote the probability distribution over the current answers of q. The entropy for q is computed as -p i log p i . We are not interested in minimizing the entropy of q, given that entropy depends solely on the answers provided by the crowd and this is something that we cannot control. Instead, we are interested in minimizing the uncertainty that we have in the entropy of q due to the existence of \\u2205 cells. We define this formally next. We define t as a matrix-specific threshold that denotes the desired number of users to answer question q. For instance, if we use a majority vote to derive an overall answer for each q, then t may express the size of the quorum (e.g., majority out of at least 5). Let v denote the number of users who answered q. Let v i denote the number of users among them who gave the answer a i \\u2208 A, and w.l.o.g., assume that\", \"A set of t answers for q may be achieved by asking t-v users to provide an answer.

The following is easy to verify.\", \"\\u2022 The minimum entropy for q is achieved if the remaining entries are all resolved as answer a 1 (the current majority). \\u2022 In contrast, the maximum entropy is achieved if we allocate x i hypothetical votes for answer a i so that the constraint\", \"and k is minimized. We define the uncertainty of q as the difference between these two extreme entropies: uncertainty(q) = maxEnt(q) -minEnt(q). Example 2.1: Consider a question q such that n = 3 (number of possible answers), t = 5 (number of desired users to answer q), and the distribution of current answers is v 1 = 2, v 2 = 1, v 3 = 1, i.e., one more \\u2205 entry needs to be resolved. The minimum entropy minEnt(q) is achieved when the remaining entry goes to the majority answer a 1 , and hence the probability distribution is p 1 = 3/5, p 2 = 1/5 and p 3 = 1/5. The maximum entropy is achieved when the remaining answer is assigned to a 2 , in which case the distribution is p 1 = 2/5, p 2 = 2/5 and p 3 = 1/5. The uncertainty of q is equal to uncertainty(q) = 0.21.\", \"Assume now that the current votes are distributed as follows: v 1 = 2, v 2 = 2 and v 3 = 0. In this case, the uncertainty in q is equal to uncertainty(q) = 0.08. The reason for this reduction is that the one remaining \\u2205 entry cannot change the distribution too much. However, in the first case, there can be either a clear majority for a 1 or a near-split vote.\", \"Having defined an uncertainty metric for each question q, we introduce an aggregate metric for the uncertainty of M . We consider two cases:\", \"(1)\", \"The first metric bounds the uncertainty of every question in the matrix, whereas the second measures the overall uncertainty of all questions.

For uncertainty sum a PTIME solution (based on dynamic programming) is possible for constraint classes [A] and [C].

SYSTEM OVERVIEW\", \"paragraph\": [\"AskIt! is implemented in Java and PHP and uses a MySQL database. Figure 1 illustrates the system architecture, divided into operating modules. The DB includes the actual query answers given by users, and the generated predictions made by the Enrichment Module. The Enrichment Module employs the Collaborative Filtering algorithms from [8] to predict user answers and determine which users are likely to answer which questions. Note, however, that the independence between the module and the rest of the systems allows to plug-in any alternative prediction technique. Given the ids of the current active users and the input from the Enrichment Module, the Constraints Manager generates corresponding constraints for which questions can currently be posed. The Prober module uses these constraints and, depending on the chosen The questions are posed to the users via the User Interface (UI). Figure 2 shows a screenshot of this operation.

When relevant, AskIt! groups and presents related questions together, to extract more information in a single probe. We finally note that AskIt! may also be run in a \\\"behind the scenes\\\" mode which disables the UI and allows it to be invoked as a service.

The collected data consists, correspondingly, of technical and qualitative information about papers and authors as well as humorous information about the conference attendees. Examples for the first type include the subdomains to which each paper is most relevant to, whether it is more theoretical or systems-oriented, the interest that the paper stimulated in the conference, the presentation quality, the areas of expertise of the authors, etc. Examples for the second type include information about the celebrity to whom various researchers most resemble to, how serious or tall they are, etc. Each user plays only for a limited time hence cannot be asked too many questions. AskIt! is thus invoked to choose what questions should be posed to which of the current players, so that the overall uncertainty about the answers\' distribution (or, alternatively, the information gain) is minimized (maximized). It is important to note that there is no single \\\"correct\\\" answer to questions and thus the goal is to approximate as much as possible the true distribution of answers, given the limited availability of users.

There may be different reasons for this similarity, ranging from the need to contain publication costs by using less page space to conforming to an internationally well-accepted format that may be perceived as the hallmark of academic articles. We surveyed 35 medical journals founded before 1960 and looked for their change in format over time and how this was experienced by and explained to readers. We then discussed what recent research has shown about the effects of layout on reading, looking for further explanations as to why this format was so successful.','[{\"header\": \"Introduction\", \"paragraph\": [\"The layout-the juxtaposition of text within a document-plays an important and yet often overlooked role in communication [1]. The choice of layout dictates how information is distributed across a page and can guide the reader through the text with visual cues, bring related information together and thereby create cohesion. Layout can be so closely associated with certain kinds of genres and certain ways of delivering information that readers can immediately recognize a newspaper, a textbook, a novel, or a web page just by looking at how lines of text are ordered in the page. Scientific articles in academic journals are no exceptions to this, as they are characterized by a consistent structure and look, both in their printed form and their, more recent, online versions. It has been shown that the choice of typeface and typographic layout affects the visual rhetorical impression of readers, and a consistent, uniform look is mostly associated with \\\"academic\\\", \\\"informative\\\", \\\"professional\\\" descriptors in experimental settings [2]. Indeed, the purpose of scientific articles is mostly to inform, to transfer knowledge and do that in a balanced, objective way, while avoiding linguistic or iconographic frills that may distract readers from this primary purpose. However, reducing the role of layout to the mere negative quality of absence of distraction would be diminishing. Although the layout can indeed serve a noise-reduction function, together with text segmentation, it also creates meaning. Academic articles are consistently structured in a pre-defined and well-known sequence of paragraphs. When it comes to the life science area, the adoption of a standardized structure, which is mostly represented by the familiar Abstract, Introduction, Materials, Results and Discussion sequence [3] helps readers navigate through the article and quickly find relevant pieces of information, as readers are able to anticipate what kind of content to expect in each section. A specific layout has also become a consistent mainstay of biomedical articles. Although most journals differ in the details of their style choices, e.g., the font used, the way paragraphs are marked, the citation style, any brief survey of publications in the Figure 1. Comparison between two mock-up texts as they would appear in A) a one-column layout or B) a two-column layout. Most academic journals adopted either one of these two formats for their articles.

In particular, the aim of this commentary is to investigate whether the common transition to a two-column format in medical journals may be associated with a change in perspective or attitude toward the scientific literature. This commentary will also consider how the change in layout relates to the introduction of abstracts in the medical literature, one of the hallmarks of scientific articles being geared towards mass indexing and searching [9].\", \"To answer this question, the present article will examine a set of biomedical journals from their beginning to today\'s issues, noting their pivoting in style in their printed versions and whether the motivations for such a change were provided.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Materials and Methods\", \"paragraph\": [\"The biomedical literature has always been rich in specialty journals, which focused on specific areas and specifically targeted physicians or researchers. We considered a cohort of 55 peer-reviewed journals in the medical field that were available online, were indexed in MEDLINE and were founded before 1960 (Table A2). This date was arbitrarily chosen because a preliminary search of the literature showed that journals were more likely to have a one-column layout before the 1960s-1970s. We then browsed the available issues starting from the first published issue and included those journals (n = 37) which were first published in a one-column format and had been digitalized for the dates of interest. The list of included journals can be found in Table 1. We decided also to include the date the journal acquired an abstract, which is an independent feature that developed over time in all journals, as the need for faster data retrieval became more prominent, to assess a possible relation between the two of them.

By comparison, the almost contemporary journal Diabetes appeared in a two-column format in 1952 but was equipped with an abstract only in January 1964. This observation holds true not only for journals established in the 1960s, as a two-column layout can also be found in earlier biomedical journals. Chest, the organ of the American College of Chest Physicians, was first published in 1935 in a two-column format, though again abstracts appeared only in July 1968. The pages of the famous British Medical Journal had a two-column layout starting from their initial issue in 1840 and, similarly to Science, were divided in two halves by a vertical black border until January 1937, when the journal underwent a revision, as explained by the editor [10].

It has been stated that readers are actually very conservative [1], grow accustomed to a format and like knowing what to expect within the frame of the sensorial experience provided by reading, which also includes visual elements. McCarty, however, conceded that this new format could more easily accommodate \\\"certain types of data\\\". Two main observations can be made here. The first and foremost is that, at a certain point in time, at least by 1990, a two-column format was perceived as more modern, possibly because by that time, most journals had already acquired or were transitioning to this format that had become mainstream. The second observation is that, by 1990, more flexibility in inserting extra-textual content, e.g., tables or figures, was needed by the editors. It is known that older studies had a more limited iconography, due to the obvious technical restraints that authors had to endure [13]. However, the appearance and diffusion of personal computers made creating graphs and figures an easier task for researchers and scientific studies were progressively adorned with richer sets of figures, hence the need to find them a place on the page.\", \"Publications 2020, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 20\"]}, {\"header\": \"Results\", \"paragraph\": [\"As we mentioned, it is well known that the two-column format was adopted by some journals right from the beginning.

The Journal of Experimental Medicine was not alone in its format choice, but was actually preceded by several others. The American Journal of Public Health, which first appeared in 1911, changed its format in 1933, preceded by the Canadian Medical Association Journal, which switched to a new layout in 1920. Its editors did not thoroughly explain the reasons for this change, beside hoping that the \\\"more attractive form\\\" [14] would be welcomed by its readers. This comment, while brief, again suggests that even by that time this new layout would somewhat affect the attitudes of readers. It is difficult not to assume there was a need to have a renewed graphical look mirror the extensive innovation the Canadian Medical Association was undergoing at the time. These changes are well described in the same issue of the journal, which was a central tool in the management of this professional association [14]. This was not the only instance that a change in typographic format occurred at a time of management change for the journal or the underlying association. Academic Medicine adopted a two-column format in 1952, when A.C. Bachmeyer was elected president of the Association of American Medical Colleges [15]. Similarly, the British Journal of Cancer changed format in 1971, when the editorial board was renewed [16]. Interestingly, the journal had just undergone a pivotal, albeit almost unnoticed, change in format in March 1970, when Summaries were moved from the end of articles to the beginning. These new Summaries were now written in bold fonts, to underline a new role for this important section of the study. The new change in layout was also accompanied in 1972 by a change in the types of accepted publications, which now included short communications and letters to the editor, together with small adjustments aiming at making the journal ready to face a surge in publications, \\\"This will be more necessary than before, in view of the large American effort planned for the seventies, which will undoubtedly result in a greatly increased flow of information\\\", [16] while remaining a palatable, yet central forum for its readers. Similarly, Anaesthesia, the organ of the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain & Ireland, transitioned to a two-column layout in 1980, when the association was renewed and Dr. Philip Helliwell was elected president [17]. By that time, this journal was already facing a big increase in the number of published studies: \\\"Readers will also notice changes in the printing and format of Anaesthesia.

Interestingly, abstracts at the beginning of articles were introduced in 1981, again on an anniversary-the 50th anniversary-of this journal. The editor commented on the choice of two columns:\", \"\\\"The new type is 10 point Baskerville, an attractive face and a somewhat more readable one than the condensed face formerly used. The practical effect of this change will be to reduce the number of characters in a given line, but this will be achieved in a more direct fashion by establishing two columns where one was used before. With this format, the reader\'s eyes will have a shorter \'swing\' from the end of one line to the beginning of the next. Two columns will also allow more flexibility in the arrangement of illustrative material with the text.\\\" [19] This crucial observation thus highlights that the layout was meant to improve the journal\'s readability, by reducing the readers\' efforts to follow through a now shorter text in shorter columns (we will come back to this issue later in this commentary). The editor also hinted at an increased flexibility in arranging figures, just like with Journal of Experimental Medicine. Similar considerations can be found in the editorial on Acta Pediatrica, when in 1991, 70 years after its foundation, the editors decided to move to a two-column format. This new layout \\\"conforms with most comparable international journals . . . .will enhance the technical standard of tables and illustrations and provide more scope for their presentation\\\". [20] It must be pointed out that having the right figures on the page is not just an editorial necessity but may be very important to readers as well. According to the spatial contiguity principle [21], the close proximity of text and images facilitates their interpretation, especially in the presence of visual cues in the text that orient the reader to check the images for the desired content, without requiring split attention to go and look for figures on other pages [22]. In this respect, the new layout could really be considered more modern, as it was indeed accomodating to modern needs of scientific papers, i.e., a richer iconography. As articles became more and more complex [23], it also became important to assist readers through the text, to improve their understanding. Actually, it is now more important than ever, given the huge amount of available literature in the biomedical field.\"]}, {\"header\": \"A Useful Choice?\", \"paragraph\": [\"Several reasons seem therefore to underlie most of the format changes that we have mentioned. The first reason why this format was so broadly adopted is confirmed to be mainly one of pure practicality: as journals had to bear the significant costs of printing their articles, they tried to increase efficiency by reducing more articles within fewer printed pages. This required smaller fonts and two columns became necessary to avoid having too many characters per line of text and thus maintain its readability. Lonsdale has actually shown that a shorter single column is significantly easier to read than a one-column text with longer lines in an academic context, for tasks such as retrieving relevant information by skimming through the text [24]. However, it is reasonable to wonder whether cost reduction alone may fully explain the success of this format.\", \"Several studies have investigated whether a two-column layout could prove advantageous over a simpler one-column format, although the results have been so far controversial [25]. Some studies have reported that single-column texts allow for faster reading, both on paper and online [26], although they acknowledge that one-column layouts may prove more challenging because they require better orientation to keep track of the beginning of new lines. This can be particularly difficult while reading on-screen texts, where aids such as using a pen or a finger are harder to use. In line with this observation is a study by Al Samarraie and Price who shows that a two-column layout required a reduced cognitive load, as revealed at EEG [27]. Reading long straight lines could then impair the ability to search for information and leap to the next idea [28]. In particular, a two-column layout would be better suited for repeated reading, where it could help the reader locate information more effectively, offering more visual cues that could guide and direct the attention of the reader to relevant parts of the text [29]. In other words, a multicolumn text would make it easier for readers to skip through lines to parts of the text that are more directly relevant for the reader, i.e., the beginning and end of the line would be used as a visual sign to bookmark important sentences or passages. This could actually be crucial when considering the attitude and purpose of readers when approaching a scientific text, as opposed to other genres such as a narrative text, e.g., a novel. A novel is supposed to be read from the start to the very end, with a continuous, uninterrupted reading flow and immersion into the universe of the story [30], with all its parts constituting a linear continuum that equally contributes to the story, within the limits of the structure of the story itself. This kind of reading is sometimes referred to as receptive reading or linear reading [1]. However, this is by far not the only way to read a text. A scientific text, such as an academic article, is mostly referential in nature and is read strategically, with the purpose of extracting relevant information [31]. Its sub-parts have functions that are not all necessarily activated in a sequence, or during the same reading session [32]. The text can be browsed, scanned, skimmed, read repeatedly, in a circular or concentric way, and some parts can even be skipped [1]. A scientific text is not approached linearly and is not approached passively. An interactive process is established between the reader and the text, and such process includes both a flow of information that is extracted from the text and a flow of information that is added by the reader to the text, most often through underlining, highlighting, adding cues, jotting down sidenotes, to create a cognitive niche that helps the reader to better understand and retain knowledge [33]. The reader takes information from the text and actively builds knowledge, using the text itself, the paper, the pencil, almost as an extension of their own mind in the learning process [34]. In this context, the layout stops being just a way to order sentences within a page but becomes an access structure to the text [1].\", \"As the amount of publications available to scholars increased, filtering relevant information became of the utmost importance. Unsurprisigly, an important tool in article selection, the abstract, was systematically introduced quite consistently around the 1970s in the set of journals we examined in this commentary. Although, retrospectively, the presence of an abstract at the beginning of each article may seem a major revolution in the structure of the text, few editors have actually commented on it. The editors of Diabetes only stated that the summary had been moved to the front page, so that it could be \\\"photographed . . . for separate indexing\\\" purposes [35]. K. S. Smith, the editor of Heart was, however, more open on what he thought about this new format he introduced shortly before he retired from that position [36]:\", \"\\\"The Journal has adopted, not without misgiving, the synoptic preface. Readers may, and editors certainly do, notice that the summary has often been the weakest part of a paper: as if the authors, exhausted by labours of composition, could not bring themselves to recrystallize their thoughts. They will now need to show special skill to summarize their aims and achievement in a space shorter than the erstwhile terminal summary.\\\" [37] The adoption of abstracts was apparently a controversial move, the scope of which was not yet completely self-explanatory to everyone, let alone readers. The Summary was a section of which the purpose-i.e., summarizing a whole study at the end of it, to better understand and appreciate it-was clear to editors and readers. However, summaries were visibly underperforming due to fact that they were placed at the end of the text, and therefore were relegated to a part of the text where little attention was commonly devoted to them. They were now being replaced by a section that was in the spotlight. In those cases where a two-column layout was introduced before the abstract, the summary was part of those two columns. However, in most cases of a two-column format, the abstract at the beginning of the text graphically overarches the two columns, ideally embracing the whole text. It is both typographically and functionally supraordinate to the rest of the text. It is the first part of the text that readers encounter just after the title. But why would readers waste time with a shorter version of an article that they are just about to read anyway? Abstracts may have even seemed as a librarian\'s tool, rather than an instrument directed at readers themselves, and this was probably true until the Internet era. In the aforementioned editorial, M. McCarty, editor of Journal of Experimental Medicine, commented: \\\"A touch of modernization has been added by having the summary appear at the beginning of each article, where readers are now accustomed to look for it in most publications\\\", [12] which would suggest again that the importance of having that section was not fully grasped at the time. If we look at Table 1, we notice that while the change in column layout usually occurred with the beginning of a solar year, and thus with a new volume, abstracts often appeared mid-year, as if they represented a minor adjustment for internal purposes, almost to be unnoticed by authors. Yet abstracts are now the emblem of the strategic approach to literature that was mentioned above. An abstract serves the purpose of quick identification of the content of a text, which is particularly useful during a literature search, where dozens or hundreds of articles are browsed and only a few pertinent works must be retained [38], and it is thus at the heart of that strategy of information retrieval that is necessary vis-\\u00e0-vis the current biomedical literature.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Taking the Alternative Path?\", \"paragraph\": [\"The development of the World Wide Web was a game changer and the revolutionary effects of digital media on reading and publishing cannot be overstated. Texts can be read on a computer screen, on a tablet, on a mobile phone or on an e-ink reader [39]. These last devices are probably less relevant for academic publishing than for novels, because they cannot render color images such as photographs or graphs with a great resolution, but more importantly because they are not really fit for non-strategic reading [1].\", \"As previously mentioned, biomedical journals are now available also in digital edition, and a growing awareness for waste consumption and ecological concerns may possibly promote the use of on-screen reading over paper printing. More and more researchers resort to reading the scientific literature-or rather browsing through the literature-on their computer screens rather than printing it. This phenomenon has been made even compulsory by the sheer volume of literature that scholars must search in their routine research activity or just to keep up to date in their field, but it has also been aided by the possibilities of hypertexting offered by digital media, which proves very useful during literature searches [40,41]. The effectiveness of digital reading compared to paper reading has been nontheless questioned, as many readers report that they still prefer reading texts on paper [42], and some studies suggest that readers may perform more poorly and have lower metacognitive awareness while reading on-screen, especially for expository texts [43][44][45][46], though possibly no differences exist in reading speed [42,45]. Optimizing articles to make them easier to read may therefore be an important goal for scientific literature. It has been investigated whether two-column formats perform equally effectively for digital reading [47]. Given the peculiar way that most computer interfaces work, scrolling is a much faster way to read than moving around the page, which, however, touchscreens have made a less cumbersome operation than on regular mouse-operated computers. Text optimization for screen viewing has been shown to reduce mental workload [48]. This is actually the reason why most publishers, as we mentioned, still offer the choice between a PDF file with standard, printer-friendly two-column formatting and an html-encoded version for digital reading. As responsive PDF viewers are not available [47], these full-text versions optimized for screen viewing usually consist of a one column of text, where font size can be easily adjusted by the reader, within a frame of header, footer, even sidebars containing additional information, hyperlinks and providing context to the main text. Some studies suggest that reading one-column texts may be significantly slower on screens than on paper [26], although caveats are necessary to note regarding the difference between speed and text comprehension in light of the purpose of the actual text, as new metrics should be evaluated [49,50].\", \"It must be, however, noted that economic factors may also compound, when the adoption of specific layouts is considered. The digital age has dramatically decreased publication costs and the introduction of new, hitherto unthinkable, business models (e.g., open access journals), together with the need of authors to have more and more articles published, has facilitated the appearance of new big editorial groups. The policy of these publishers is often to make uniform the journal layout and appearance for easier management of the publishing operations. Such is, for instance, the case with MDPI, a relatively young publishing company that has consistently adopted a one-column format for both the html and PDF versions of its articles. Unlike many publishers, and definitely unlike what was habitually done in the past [51], its journals almost completely delegate manuscript preparation to authors. Most word processors that are commonly used by researchers worldwide are very apt at handling one column of text, and this layout format is arguably easier to manage than two-column layouts. A further explanation of this choice of layout is that it may be reasonable to provide articles in a format that is optimized for screen reading, as texts are not printed as often than they used to. This publisher may be therefore betting that readers will eventually make the transition and move to a fully digital reading experience (getting over the cognitively more gratifying experience of paper), and that the predominant part of the strategic reading of an article will be to scroll the text for very select pieces of information.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Where To?\", \"paragraph\": [\"Any survey at how this important-and yet so often overlooked-feature of scientific texts has changed over time leads to the conclusion that biomedical journals have mostly migrated from a one-column layout, which was popular at end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, to a two-column format in a period of time that in most examined cases was between 1960 and 1980. This change was mostly fueled by the need to save printed paper and by the higher flexibility of two-column layouts to accommodate graphical elements. However, most editors acknowledged that the new layout was somewhat more modern, or pleasant, or legible, thus confirming the relevance of this aspect of text composition in providing access to the content of the journal and its articles. More recently, the introduction of digital media has revived one-column texts again, and these may see a surge in popularity, as computer screens are the routine way to approach scientific texts. In spite of the long experience of the importance of layout in textbook understanding, relatively little attention has been devoted to using the layout as a way to facilitate information finding in the academic biomedical literature. This may be at least in part due to a prejudice, i.e., that scientific literature should be foreign to the frills of leisure publishing and that its readers should not be enticed by graphics or design but should rather solely focus on content. Yet page design is just another way to make content more accessible, and the importance of quickly identifying relevant data in an age of literature overload cannot be overstated. Further research should therefore be conducted to better delineate optimal layouts for the need of the readers of biomedical literature, to optimize the readers\' experience even in this regard, as reading retains and will retain its rightful place at the heart of the whole academic publishing industry.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Acknowledgments:\", \"paragraph\": [\"Funding: This research received no external funding.\", \"The authors would like to thank Lorenzo Magnani and Selene Arfini (Computational Philosophy Lab, University of Pavia) for their insights on cognitive niche construction.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Acknowledgments:\", \"paragraph\": [\"The authors would like to thank Lorenzo Magnani and Selene Arfini (Computational Philosophy Lab, University of Pavia) for their insights on cognitive niche construction.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Conflicts of Interest:\", \"paragraph\": [\"The authors declare no conflict of interest.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Conflicts of Interest:\", \"paragraph\": [\"The authors declare no conflict of interest.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Appendix A\", \"paragraph\": []}]','https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tHzXDSwU7F8QtIf0bLJOj8q4TpEi3bwC&export=download','2020-02-05',0,'2024-02-05 13:08:14.216897','2024-02-05 13:08:18.243102'),(6,'High Spectral Resolution and Accuracy Studies for a Sr Optical Lattice Clock','We report recent progress on an optical lattice clock based on the 1 S 0 -3 P 0 transition of 87 Sr. Improvement of the spectral resolution allows measurement of the magneticallyinduced frequency shift with an uncertainty below 10 -15 .

These optical lattice clocks provide relatively high signal-to-noise from the large numbers of atoms, while at the same time allowing Doppler-free interrogation of the clock transitions for long probing times. Atomic Strontium provides an exciting candidate for such a clock, since the level structure provides a means for cooling the sample to \\u00b5K temperatures as well as multiple narrow clock transitions. Several techniques are under investigation for the Sr clock transitions, including free-space spectroscopy of the 1 S 0 -3 P 1 transition in 88 Sr [5], lattice-based spectroscopy of the 1 S 0 -3 P 0 transition in 87 Sr [1][2][3][4], and state-mixing schemes such as electromagnetically-induced-transparency [6,7] or use of a DC magnetic field [3] for spectroscopy of the strictly forbidden 1 S 0 -3 P 0 transition in 88 Sr. Currently, detailed evaluations of systematic effects for the sub-Hz natural linewidth transition in 87 Sr are being performed in several independent systems [1,2,8].

In the case of neutral Sr, we use two cooling transitions (the 32-MHz-wide 1 S 0 -1 P 1 transition at 461 nm followed by the 7.4-kHz-wide 1 S 0 -3 P 1 transition at 689 nm) in order to cool the atoms to \\u00b5K temperatures before loading them into the optical lattice.

An attractive solution is the tight confinement offered by an optical lattice, which allows long interaction times while essentially eliminating any Doppler or recoil effects. When the optical lattice is operated at the \'magic\' wavelength, AC stark shifts induced by the lattice field become equal for the 1 S 0 and 3 P 0 energy levels. In this manner, the clock transition frequency is unperturbed by the presence of the lattice field. Our one-dimensional lattice is constructed from a ~300 mW wtanding wave of optical power at the magic wavelength of ~813.4 nm, and is oriented nearly parallel to the direction of gravity. After transfer from the second laser-cooling stage to the lattice, > 10 4 atoms at ~1.5 \\u00b5K temperatures are confined with a Lamb-Dicke parameter of ~0.3, allowing Dopplerand recoil-free spectroscopy of the clock transition along the axis of the lattice beam.\"]}, {\"header\": \"C.

The high-finesse cavity is mounted in a vertical orientation in order to reduce sensitivity to vibrations in the vertical direction [11]. To characterize our clock laser, we compare it to a second stable laser operating at 1064 nm by use of the femtosecond comb described in the next section. Although the probe laser system used for our 2005 systematic measurements had net optical phase noise leading to measured spectra of linewidth > 200 Hz during the measurements, improvements to both the design and construction of the cavity now provide laser linewidths (at 698 nm) below 0.5 Hz for a 3-s integration time and ~ 10 Hz for a 60-s integration time.

The 80-Hz error made by [2] has since been resolved; a third independent measurement reported in [8] is now in good agreement with our value.

Using information technology in hospital administration does not only increase the operation efficiency, but also reduce the cost. However, with an increasing amount of administrative and clinical data, it needs continuous improvement to process the information accurately and immediately. People consider healthcare services very personnel and important to them, and demand both the effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare services. Therefore, the hospitals compete with each other not only in the treatment effectiveness but also in the administrative efficiency.\", \"There are various factors that affect the patients\' satisfaction. Some researchers found waiting time is very critical. Procedures such as registration, seeing a doctor, paying fee, and getting medicine can take long time for waiting. The longer the waiting time is, the lower the patients\' satisfaction. When there\'s waiting line, patients could not get what they need immediately. Most of the time, the hospitals can\'t afford to hire many receptionists sitting in the front desk. The hospitals therefore install self-service technologies (SST) such as ATM, vending machine, and booking machine to enhance their services. Without increasing the human resources, the patients can still finish their procedures quickly. The hospitals can therefore provide satisfactory services with minimum cost. This is the concept of self-service technology. The research questions are who are going to use it and who won\'t? Are there inherent factors to influence the use of SST? What will be the best predictor of satisfaction and intention of use? By investigating the above research questions, we can make better decisions regarding the adoption and use of SST.\", \"The hospital we studied has a good reputation of providing patient-centric medical services as well as the pioneer of adoption of cutting-edged e-services.

Several optimization problems are considered to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed iSSO.','[{\"header\": \"Introduction\", \"paragraph\": [\"Structural optimization may be defined as the rational establishment of an economical structural design with the available resources while satisfying specific performance criteria. In general terms, the economy may be characterized by minimum weight, minimum cost, maximum utility, or even minimum probability of failure. Broadly, structural optimization can be categorized into deterministic and stochastic optimization [1,2]. The classical statement of unconstraint deterministic optimization is mathematically expressed as: minimize : \\u03c6\\u2208\\u03a6 g(\\u03c6) (1) where, \\u03c6 = [\\u03c6 1 \\u22ef\\u03c6 n\\u03c6 ] T \\u2208 \\u03a6\\u2282R n\\u03c6 is a set of deterministic adjustable parameters that define the structural design, referred to herein as design parameters, g(\\u03c6) : R n\\u03c6 \\u2192R is the objective function to be minimized, and \\u03a6 denotes the bounded admissible design space. The deterministic constraints can be considered by the appropriate definition of the admissible design space \\u03a6 for deterministic design parameters \\u03c6, as mentioned in [3]. In the deterministic structural optimization problem, the uncertainties in parameters are ignored, and fixed values are assumed for all the parameters. There are numerous optimizations approaches available in the literature, however, but it\'s worth noting that no one-size-fits-all optimization approach is ideal for all sorts of problems [4][5][6][7]. The choice of optimization method is often determined by the specific characteristics of the problem, such as its complexity, dimensionality, constraints, and the nature of the objective function. As a result, there is always a scope for new approaches to be developed or the adaptation of existing methods to better suit specific problem classes. A detailed discussion of deterministic optimization approaches can be found in the literature [8,9]. In any practical situation, several parameters, such as loadings, structural parameters, geometric parameters, operation conditions, etc., are either not known at the design stage or are subjected to random fluctuations that give rise to performance variability and affect the performance of a system [10]. These parameters are characterized as uncertain parameters. Deterministic structural optimization discards the impact of uncertainty and can result in improper design. Therefore, it is desirable to account for the uncertainty in the parameters during optimization by using the rational methods of probabilistic structural analysis [11]. Such structural optimization that accounts for uncertainties is called stochastic optimization [12]. Although stochastic optimization refers to any method that employs randomness within some communities, in this paper, we will only consider settings where the objective function is random. Stochastic optimization or optimal design under uncertainty has been widely applied in many practical engineering fields, including civil engineering structures [13][14][15], composite structures [16,17], and vehicles [18,19].\", \"Consider an engineering system that involves deterministic design parameters \\u03c6, and uncertain variables \\u03b8 = [\\u03b8 1 \\u22ef\\u03b8 n\\u03b8 ] T \\u2208 \\u0398\\u2282R n\\u03b8 following a joint PDF p(\\u03b8|\\u03c6), where \\u0398 denotes the parameter space of the uncertain variables. The classical statement of stochastic optimization is mathematically expressed as:\", \"where, h(\\u03c6, \\u03b8) : R n\\u03b8 +n\\u03c6 \\u2192R is the structural performance function, and E \\u03b8 [ \\u22c5 ] denotes expectation with respect to the PDF for \\u03b8. Note that the objective function in the optimization problem in (2) is the expectation E \\u03b8 [h(\\u03c6, \\u03b8)] which is a deterministic function. It\'s worth mentioning that stochastic optimization may also involve other stochastic measures such as variance or quantile values. However, these stochastic measures can rarely be evaluated analytically; therefore, several methods have been proposed for solving stochastic optimization problems. These specialized methods include, for example, sample average approximation, stochastic approximation, stochastic subset optimization, and approaches based on the use of Taylor series expansion [15,20,21], response surface, and metamodels [22][23][24][25]. Specific to structural engineering, there are two broad categories of problems involving design optimization under uncertainty [26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35]: Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO) and Robust Design Optimization (RDO). The objective of RBDO is to find an optimal solution that minimizes some deterministic, objective function under observance of probabilistic constraints instead of conventional deterministic constraints [36,37].\", \"On the other hand, RDO aims to find an optimal solution that is insensitive (or less sensitive) to input variations. It improves the design quality by minimizing performance variation without eliminating uncertainty [29,38]. Taflanidis and Beck [39] introduced a novel algorithm for optimal reliability problem, the so-called SSO. SSO involves formulating an augmented problem where the design parameters are artificially considered uncertain and defining an auxiliary PDF that includes the structural performance function and the PDF of the uncertain variables. Next, SSO involves generating a pool of samples distributed according to this auxiliary PDF and identifying a subregion in the original design space, which, on average, improves the value of the objective function. By repeating this procedure several times, it is possible to determine at each step a smaller subregion in the design space, which in turn improves the value of the objective function. Ultimately, this subregion will be sufficiently small to directly identify the optimal solution or provide sufficient information to launch another optimization algorithm, such as the sample average approximation or stochastic approximation. The implementation of the SSO method closely resembles the Subset Simulation (SS) algorithm [40] for reliability analysis. Since SSO is based on simulation, it can deal with linear or nonlinear problems and, at least theoretically, an unbounded number of design parameters. The numerical effort for solving a given optimization problem is independent of the number of uncertain variables, and it grows linearly with the number of design parameters.\", \"Since the introduction of SSO, several extensions of SSO have been proposed. An extension of SSO termed Non-Parametric SSO, which adopts kernel density estimation to approximate the objective function, is presented in [41]. In [42], efficient integration of the Moving Least Squares approximation within SSO is introduced to reduce the computational effort in SSO. In [3], an augmented formulation is presented for the RDO of structures using SSO. SSO or its variants have also been applied to solve structural optimization problems. SSO has been used for reliability optimization and sensitivity analysis in system design in [39]. A framework for RDO of Tuned Mass Dampers (TMD) by SSO is discussed in [43]. Even though SSO has proved to be efficient for meeting various challenging optimization problems, it has two shortcomings. First, the effectiveness of SSO is dependent on the correct selection of the geometrical shape of the admissible subsets. Here, it is pertinent to mention that choosing a geometrical shape that effectively investigates the sensitivity of the objective function to each design variable is essential. The shapes, such as hyper-rectangle and hyper-ellipse are suggested in the literature for the admissible subsets. However, as shown later via the illustrative example, these shapes fail to include the optimal solution in cases with complex design spaces or problems with multiple optimal solutions. And second, identifying the optimal subset that contains the smallest volume density involves a non-smooth optimization problem which is quite challenging.\", \"In this paper, an improved version of SSO is developed to overcome the shortcomings of the original SSO. This new version of the algorithm, as mentioned earlier, is named iSSO (improved SSO). Voronoi tessellation is implemented to partition the design space into non-overlapping subregions (a set of Voronoi cells) using the pool of samples distributed according to the auxiliary PDF. The admissible set (a set of all admissible subregions) is then defined as a set containing all subsets of the set of Voronoi cells. This approach is able to capture the regions with lower objective function values even if they are disjointed or when the design space is complex. The details of the Voronoi tessellation are presented in Appendix A. A double-sort algorithm is then implemented to identify the optimal subset containing the smallest volume density.\", \"In the next section, the original SSO is reviewed.

Second, a novel \\\"double sort\\\" approach is proposed, eliminating the need for optimization to identify the subregions for the optimal design at each iSSO iteration. Several mathematical and engineering design examples, including TMD, 120 bars truss structure, and base-isolated structure, are included in this study to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed iSSO. The results show that the proposed iSSO effectively identifies the reduced design space for complex design problems with multiple global and local minima. This is attributable to the Voronoi tessellation, which eliminates the requirement of the presumed admissible design space form to resemble the contour of the original design. Voronoi tessellation enabled better design space exploration, allowing multiple global minima scattered throughout the design pace to be effectively identified. Due to the discretization of the design space via Voronoi tessellation, computation demand is significantly reduced as the number of function evaluations for all examples is lower vis-a-vis the original SSO. Moreover, the novel idea of the double sort approach achieves the requisite precision in identifying the subregions for optimal solutions and makes iSSO implementation simple and effective.

INTRODUCTION\", \"paragraph\": [\"The non-renewable energy sources are rapidly running out, while the electricity demand is increasing daily. To solve this problem, efficient and efficient electric power generation from renewable energy sources is required [1]. Renewable energy is one of the forms of energy that society can rely on because It is unpolluted, pure, and has no limits. One type of power generation that uses renewable energy is the photovoltaic (PV) system [2]. To utilize less conventional energy, the PV system must subsequently be linked to the grid, either directly or via a backup battery bank. Since the power produced by PV systems depends on radiation and temperature change, the PV framework has destitute productivity, [2].\", \"For the control of the PV systems, there are different sorts of DC-DC converters such as Buck converters, Boost converters, and Buck-Boost converters. Due to its output pick-up adaptability, a single-ended primary-inductor converter (SEPIC) acts as a buck-boost DC/DC converter, where it changes its output voltage agreeing to its duty cycle. Unlike the customary buck-boost converter, the SEPIC converter includes a non-inverted output and it uses an arrangement capacitor to separate input from output [3]. The buck and buck-boost converters lose half of their input control due to input current arrangement exchange; for that reason, the two types of converters should be excluded from maximum power applications. The boost converter has a nonstop input current, but the output voltage is always bigger than the input, which may not accomplish maximum power exchange operation in a few cases, such as when the maximum voltage is less than the input [3]. This paper presents a fuzzy-based P&O strategy for an MPPT standalone PV system. The proposed MPPT can abuse the preferences of the P&O strategy and eliminate its drawbacks. Output has been separated into five fuzzy subsets. As the proposed strategy continuously exchanges maximum power from PV arrays, it optimizes the number of PV modules.\"]}, {\"header\": \"II.

SEPIC CONVERTER\", \"paragraph\": [\"Power electronics researchers are working hard to create DC-DC converters with simpler designs and greater efficiency [7]. To maintain a constant output voltage, the suggested DC-to-DC converter employs a single-ended primary-inductor converter (SEPIC) architecture. The SEPIC converter is made up of a duty cycle switch S, a diode, two inductors (L1 and L2), two capacitors (C1 and C2), and a load resistor. Figure 2 depicts the circuit diagram of a SEPIC converter. A SEPIC is a DC-DC converter [8]. SEPIC are DC-DC converters that can output voltages that are B, larger than, or equal to the input voltage. The duty cycle of the control transistor affects the SEPIC converter\'s output voltage. The SEPIC converter is two converters in one: a boost converter followed by a buck-boost converter. It has the advantages of having a non-inverted output (the output voltage has the same polarity as the input voltage) , using a series capacitor to couple energy from the input to the output (which makes it more responsive to short-circuits), and being able to shut down completely: when the switch \\\"S\\\" is turned off, the output voltage drops to 0 V, accompanied by a significant transient discharge of charge.   When the switch is turned on, the input inductor is charged from the source, and the second inductor is charged from the first capacitor. No energy is supplied to the load capacitor during this time. The inductor current and capacitor voltage polarities are marked in this Figure . When the power switch is turned off, the energy stored in the inductor is transferred. The energy stored is transferred through the diode and supplies the energy to the load [10], as shown in Figure 3. b. The second inductor is also connected to the load during this time. The output capacitor sees a pulse of current during the off time, making it inherently noisier than a buck converter. The amount that the SEPIC converters increase or decrease the voltage depends primarily on the duty cycle and the parasitic elements in the circuit. The output of an ideal SEPIC converter is:\", \"A SEPIC converter is to process the electricity from the PV system. This converter either increases or decreases the PV system voltage at the load. The proposed SEPIC converter operates in buck mode.\"]}, {\"header\": \"IV. FUZZY LOGIC CONTROL\", \"paragraph\": [\"In the fuzzy logic maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm, the voltage and current at each instant k are measured to calculate the active power. The active power is then compared with the power at the previous instant (k-1) to obtain the change in power (\\u0394P(k)). Similarly, the voltage at instant k is compared with the voltage at instant k-1 to obtain the voltage error (\\u0394V(k)) [11]. The power error is then divided by the current error to obtain the error (E). The error is then compared with the previous error to calculate the change in error (\\u0394E(k)). The error (E(k)) and the change in error (\\u0394E(k)) are then used as the crisp inputs to the fuzzy logic controller. The flow chart for the fuzzy logic MPPT algorithm is shown in Figure 4. In this work, the Mamdani inference technique, Atype membership functions, and a 25-element rule base were used for the fuzzy logic control. The Mamdani inference technique is efficient and straightforward in defining the fuzzy output sets, and it is more popular among researchers than other inference techniques [12]. The A-type or triangular membership function is used because it is simpler to split into low and high membership functions (MFs) than other membership functions. Additionally, it has been observed that the triangular membership function has a faster response and less overshoot than other functions [13]. A 25-element rule base was used because it has been shown to perform well [14][15]. The following are the fuzzy rules in Table 1, which are used for the desired MPP of push-pull converter PWM.

These types of variables are becoming increasingly important in several surrogate modeling applications. SMT 2.0 also improves SMT by extending sampling methods, adding new surrogate models, and computing variance and kernel derivatives for Kriging. This release also includes new functions to handle noisy and use multi-fidelity data. To the best of our knowledge, SMT 2.0 is the first open-source surrogate library to propose surrogate models for hierarchical and mixed inputs.','[{\"header\": \"Motivation and significance\", \"paragraph\": [\"With the increasing complexity and accuracy of numerical models, it has become more challenging to run complex simulations and computer codes [1,2]. As a consequence, surrogate models have been recognized as a key tool for engineering tasks such as design space exploration, uncertainty quantification, and optimization [3]. In practice, surrogate models are used to reduce the computational effort of these tasks by replacing expensive numerical simulations with closed-form approximations [4,Ch. 10]. To build such a model, we start by evaluating the original expensive simulation at a set of points through a Design of Experiments (DoE). Then, the corresponding evaluations are used to build the surrogate model according to the chosen approximation, such as Kriging, quadratic interpolation, or least squares regression.\", \"The Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT) is an open-source framework that provides functions to efficiently build surrogate models [5]. and number of instantiated elements. When design problems include both discrete variables and continuous variables, they are said to have mixed variables.\", \"When architectural choices lead to different sets of design variables, we have hierarchical variables [21,22]. For example, consider different aircraft propulsion architectures [23]. A conventional gas turbine would not require a variable to represent a choice in the electrical power source, while hybrid or pure electric propulsion would require such a variable. The relationship between the choices and the sets of variables can be represented by a hierarchy.\", \"Handling hierarchical and mixed variables requires specialized surrogate modeling techniques [24]. To address these needs, SMT 2.0 is offering researchers and practitioners a collection of cutting-edge tools to build surrogate models with continuous, mixed and hierarchical variables. The main objective of this paper is to detail the new enhancements that have been added in this release compared to the original SMT 0.2 release [5]. There are two new major capabilities in SMT 2.0: the ability to build surrogate models involving mixed variables and the support for hierarchical variables within Kriging models. To handle mixed variables in Kriging models, existing libraries such as BoTorch [25], Dakota [26], DiceKriging [27], LVGP [28], Parmoo [29], and Spearmint [30] implement simple mixed models by using either continuous relaxation (CR), also known as one-hot encoding [30], or a Gower distance (GD) based correlation kernel [31]. KerGP [32] (developed in R) implements more general kernels but there is no Python open-source toolbox that implements more general kernels to deal with mixed variables, such as the homoscedastic hypersphere (HH) [33] and exponential homoscedastic hypersphere (EHH) [34] kernels. Such kernels require the tuning of a large number of hyperparameters but lead to more accurate Kriging surrogates than simpler mixed kernels [34,35]. SMT 2.0 implements all these kernels (CR, GD, HH, and EHH) through a unified framework and implementation. To handle hierarchical variables, no library in the literature can build peculiar surrogate models except SMT 2.0, which implements two Kriging methods for these variables. Notwithstanding, most softwares are compatible with a na\\u00efve strategy called the imputation method [24] but this method lacks depth and depends on arbitrary choices. This is why Hutter and Osborne [21] proposed a first kernel, called Arc-Kernel which in turn was generalized by Horn et al. [36] with a new kernel called the Wedge-Kernel [37]. None of these kernels are available in any open-source modeling software. Furthermore, thanks to the framework introduced in Audet et al. [38], our proposed kernels are sufficiently general so that all existing hierarchical kernels are included within it. Section 4 describes the two kernels implemented in SMT 2.0 that are referred as SMT Arc-Kernel and SMT Alg-Kernel. In particular, Alg-Kernel is a novel hierarchical kernel introduced in this paper. Table 1 outlines the main features of the state-of-the-art modeling software that can handle hierarchical and mixed variables.\", \"SMT 2.0 introduces other enhancements, such as additional sampling procedures, new surrogate models, new Kriging kernels (and their derivatives), Kriging variance derivatives, and an adaptive criterion for high-dimensional problems. SMT 2.0 adds applications of Bayesian optimization (BO) with hierarchical and mixed variables or noisy co-Kriging that have been successfully applied to aircraft design [39], data fusion [40], and structural design [41]. The SMT 2.0 interface is more user-friendly and offers an improved and more detailed documentation for users and developers. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, we introduce the organization and the main implemented features of the release in Section 2. Then, we describe the mixed-variable Kriging model with an example in Section 3.

A Python surrogate modeling framework with derivatives. One of the original main motivations for SMT was derivative support. In fact, none of the existing packages for surrogate modeling such as Scikit-learn in Python [7], SUMO in Matlab [42] or GPML in Matlab and Octave [43] focuses on derivatives. Three types of derivatives are distinguished: prediction derivatives, training derivatives, and output derivatives. SMT also includes new models with derivatives such as Kriging with Partial Least Squares (KPLS) [44] and Regularized Minimal-energy Tensor-product Spline (RMTS) [3]. These developed derivatives were even used in a novel algorithm called Gradient-Enhanced Kriging with Partial Least Squares (GEKPLS) [6] to use with adjoint methods, for example [45].\", \"Software architecture, documentation, and automatic testing. SMT is organized along three main sub-modules that implement a set of sampling techniques (sampling_methods), benchmarking functions (problems), and surrogate modeling techniques (surrogate_models). The toolbox documentation 6 is created using reStructuredText and Sphinx, a documentation generation package for Python, with custom extensions. Code snippets in the documentation pages are taken directly from actual tests in the source code and are automatically updated. The output from these code snippets and tables of options are generated dynamically by custom Sphinx extensions. This leads to high-quality documentation with minimal effort. Along with user documentation, developer documentation is also provided to explain how to contribute to SMT. This includes a list of API methods for the SurrogateModel, SamplingMethod, and Problem classes, that must be implemented to create a new surrogate modeling method, sampling technique, or benchmarking problem. When a developer submits a pull request, it is merged only after passing the automated tests and receiving approval from at least one reviewer. The repository on GitHub7 is linked to continuous integration tests (GitHub Actions) for Windows, Linux and MacOS, to a coverage test on coveralls.io and to a dependency version check for Python with DependaBot. Various parts of the source code have been accelerated using Numba [46], an LLVM-based just-in-time (JIT) compiler for numpy-heavy Python code. Numba is applied to conventional Python code using function decorators, thereby minimizing its impact on the development process and not requiring an additional build step. For a mixed Kriging surrogate with 150 training points, a speedup of up to 80% is observed, see Table 2.

The hierarchical structure of the design space can be defined using declare_decreed_var:\", \"this function declares that a variable is a decreed variable that is activated when the associated meta variable takes one of a set of specified values, see Section 4 for background. The DesignSpace class also implements mechanisms for sampling valid design vectors (i.e. design vectors that adhere to the hierarchical structure of the design space) using any of the below-mentioned samplers, for correcting and imputing design vectors, and for requesting which design variables are acting in a given design vector. Correction ensures that variables have valid values (e.g. integers for discrete variables) [24], and imputation replaces non-acting variables by some default value (0 for discrete variables, mid-way between the bounds for continuous variables in SMT 2.0) [47].\", \"Sampling. SMT implements three methods for sampling. The first one is a na\\u00efve approach, called Random that draws uniformly points along every dimension. The second sampling method is called Full Factorial and draws a point for every cross combination of variables, to have an \'\'exhaustive\'\' design of experiments. The last one is the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) [48] that draws a point in every Latin square parameterized by a certain criterion.

More details about the new models are given in Section 6.2.\", \"Applications. Several applications have been added to the toolbox to demonstrate the surrogate models capabilities.

Note that GENN applies to regression (single-output or multi-output), but not classification since there is no gradient in that case.

A more recent approach based on Karhunen-Lo\\u00e8ve decomposition of the covariance kernel with the Nystr\\u00f6m method has been proposed in [83] where the paths can be sampled by generating independent standard Normal distributed samples.

Innovations in the field of engineering education continue to take place with new developments on the horizon.\", \"There exist several studies investigating the modern engineering curricula and evaluating their effectiveness. It is argued in [6] that engineering educators must prepare their students to face three key challenges: sustainability, the 4th Industrial Revolution, and employability. The authors find that colleges and universities are responding to these challenges by emphasizing student-centered learning, integration of theory and practice, digital and online learning, and the definition of professional competencies. In particular, response to the needs of Industry 4.0 require interdisciplinary collaboration across several programs and disciplines. Interaction and integration of technologies plays a key role in this process [10], [12]. Interdisciplinary engineering education requires sound pedagogy and teaming experiences to encourage student in collaborative and interdisciplinary practice [23].\", \"Digital and online learning have become an important part of modern education including in the field of engineering.

UNIVERSITY MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM\", \"paragraph\": [\"The mathematics curriculum changed very little in the current century. It remains a largely analytic domain, where solutions are mainly obtained manually. The current mathematics curriculum emphasizes theory over practical approaches. For instance, when finding the extreme values of a function, derivative-based approach is preferred over the gradient decent. There are two key reasons for why analytical approaches are favored over numerical methods. First, analytical solutions are reliable and elegant. An analytical solution is guaranteed to be exact. Second, mathematics courses are usually taught by pure mathematicians who have an inherent preference for analytical solutions. Pure mathematics which is based on theorem proving is not amenable to numerical methods.\", \"Despite the popularity of analytical approaches to problem solving in mathematics, there has been a growing push to integrate computer algebra systems as part of the learning process. Computer algebra systems such as Matlab and Mathematica are now routinely used in many mathematics courses. The study by Cretchley et al. [5] found that engineering students were positive about the use of technology as a learning tool in mathematics courses. The increased use of technology in class helped improve student focus and interest in lectures. Student evaluations also indicated that they had a greater level of enjoyment towards the lectures due to the use of technology. It is noteworthy that students chose not to rely too heavily on technology during the examinations despite the freedom to do so. The students found it extremely important to be competent with analytical mathematical skills as opposed to purely computational skills. Some revealed that they learn the subjects equally well without the help of scientific packages, although the perception towards the use of computer is in general highly positive. Almost all students responded positively to Matlab as an effective tool for computation and graphing. Many used Matlab for non-examination purposes. For example, they utilized it to check their handwritten mathematical steps in assignments and practice problems; and others used it for exploration beyond the standard syllabus and curriculum.\", \"The influence of computer technology on students\' academic performance and learning experience has been investigated by several authors. Abdul Majid et al. [1], [2] used Matlab as an aid to teach calculus to engineering students. The software package was used for various course learning outcomes such as graphical display of mathematical functions, exploration, identifying and predicting structural patterns in evaluating a series of complex indefinite integrals, and numerical approximations in applied mathematics. The study showed a positive impact on students\' academic performance in the final examinations. The study concluded that the integration of scientific packages into engineering mathematics courses could be effective under certain conditions. Similarly, other studies [18], [21] also found a positive impact from the use of scientific software packages on students\' motivation in learning mathematics.\", \"In a separate study by Brake [3], the authors investigated the use of Matlab in engineering mathematics courses to increase student confidence level and mathematical abilities. Matlab was used to solve concrete engineering problems which require a deep understanding of underlying mathematical principles. The study found generally positive student response to the use of software in their mathematics courses. However, the results of the study must be considered carefully given the small sample size of the subjects.\", \"Although the majority of the studies were based on the use of Matlab, several other studies considered alternative mathematics software packages. The study by Kilicman et al. [11] focused on the use of Maple to help students understand both the theoretical and computational aspects of linear algebra for engineering students. In particular, it was shown that the use of Maple facilitates the understanding of computational aspects of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It allows students more time to focus on the theoretical aspects and the underlying mathematical principles.\", \"In a recent study by Mezhennaya and Pugachev [14], the authors compared engineering students\' perceptions regarding several mathematical software: Matlab, Mathematica and Excel. The study found that all the scientific packages considered can be used in education, under the condition that the policies for software usage are carefully implemented. The study found that many students lack hands-on experience on how to use the software. The students particularly struggled with Matlab and Mathematica finding them non user friendly. The study concluded that additional classes are required to prepare students to use software in their courses.\"]}, {\"header\": \"IV. NUMERICAL COMPUTING IN MATHEMATICS\", \"paragraph\": [\"CURRICULUM Mathematics lies at the foundation of science and engineering. The importance of mathematics courses in engineering education cannot be underestimated. These courses equip students with the fundamental skills and knowledge to study the more specialized engineering courses. Thus, student success in engineering studies depends directly on the mathematics and sciences courses. Given the significance of the mathematics courses in the engineering curriculum, it is paramount to ensure their currency with respect to the Industry 4.0.\", \"The technological advances over the last decade have created demand for more computationally proficient experts. To meet this demand, numerical computing must become a core part of engineering studies. Mathematics courses offer a natural and convenient avenue for introducing numerical computing to engineering students. There are two main factors that make mathematics courses particularly amenable to numerical computing. First, in many cases mathematical problems have numerical solutions. For instance, finding the root of a polynomial or the minimum value of a function can be done numerically. Therefore, it is both logical and appropriate to apply numerical computing to mathematical problems. Second, mathematics courses are usually taken at the beginning of the study plan. Thus, students become acquainted with numerical computing at an early stage. The computing and programming skills acquired in this manner will have a positive effect in the more advanced, downstream engineering courses.\", \"The key idea for the proposed curriculum update is the addition of computing tutorials (labs) to mathematics courses. In particular, we propose adding weekly computing tutorials (labs) related to the main lecture material. For instance, in the week in which students cover finding the extreme values of a function, there will be a computing tutorial where students learn and implement the gradient descent algorithm. The suggested length of each tutorial is 1 hour. It is enough time to implement most of the numerical algorithms at the undergraduate level. At the same time, 1 extra hour per week will not overburden the students.\", \"The exact details of numerical computing content is left for individual universities and instructors. Depending on the syllabus and course learning outcomes, the numerical computing labs will be different for each university and instructor. Nevertheless, the general ideas will be broadly similar across different curricula. To illustrate the proposed numerical computing content, we will focus on the three main concept in calculus: limits, derivatives, and integrals.\"]}, {\"header\": \"A. Limits\", \"paragraph\": [\"Limit is a fundamental concept in calculus. Students are usually taught to calculate limits using analytical approaches. Although analytical approaches work well, there is no single universal rule for calculating limits. On the other hand, in most cases, limits can be calculated numerically using essentially the same approach. To illustrate, suppose we want to calculate lim x\\u2192a + f (x). Then we can loop for k = 0 to n and calculate f (a+ 10 -k ). As k increases, a+ 10 -k approaches a, so f (a+ 10 -k ) will, in most cases, approach the limit value. We can deduce the limit by observing the values of f (a + 10 -k ) or determine that the limit does not exist if there is no pattern of convergence. The value of n can be chosen manually or using a stopping criterion. For instance, the algorithm may continue to iterate until the difference between consecutive values of f (a + 10 -k ) is below a certain threshold. The value of the limit can also be deduced automatically based on the values of f (a + 10 -k ) using various heuristics.\", \"Another common limit problem is lim x\\u2192\\u221e f (x). In this case, we can loop for k = 0 to n and calculate f (10 k ). As k increases, 10 k approaches \\u221e, so f (10 k ) will, in most cases, approach the limit value. Then the limit can be determined based on the values of f (10 k ). Various extensions and customizations of this basic approach can be made. For instance, to avoid issues with periodic functions f (10 k + \\u01eb k ), where \\u01eb k are randomly generated, can be used. Other values than 10 k can also be used as long as the sequence approaches infinity. A degree of automization can be introduced using different heuristics.\"]}, {\"header\": \"B. Derivative\", \"paragraph\": [\"Derivative is arguably the most important concept in calculus. There exist several rules such as the power rule, the product rule, the chain rule, and others to find the derivative of a function by hand. However, manual differentiation may be cumbersome when dealing with complex function. On the other hand, calculating the derivative at a point numerically is relatively straightforward. To illustrate, suppose that we want to calculate f \\u2032 (a). Recall that\", \"Therefore, to calculate f \\u2032 (a) numerically we use the same approach as with the limits. In particular, we can loop for k = 0 to n and calculate f (a+10 -k )-f (a) 10 -k\", \". Then the limit, and by extension the derivative, can be deduced (approximated) based on the calculated values. The accuracy of the approximation depends in large part on the value of n.\", \"One of the most important applications of the derivative is finding the extreme values of a function. Traditionally, this is done by first finding the critical points of the function and then applying the second derivative test. However, finding the critical points is not always possible, so numerical approaches can be used in such cases. The most popular numerical approach for finding the extreme values is based on the gradient descent (ascent) algorithm. In gradient descent, the optimal value of x is iteratively updated based on the gradient. In particular, for k = 0 to n, the updated optimal value of x is given by\", \"where \\u2207f (x) is the gradient and \\u03b1 is the step size. In the case of a single-variable function, the gradient equals simply to the derivative \\u2207f (x) = f \\u2032 (x). The step size \\u03b1 can be either fixed or dynamic. While a large value of \\u03b1 accelerates the convergence at the beginning, it may hurt the convergence in the region near the optimal value. There exist several extensions of the basic gradient descent algorithm. One such extension is gradient descent with momentum which uses the second derivative to anticipate the location of the next optimal point and thus accelerates the convergence.\"]}, {\"header\": \"C. Integrals\", \"paragraph\": [\"Integration is an important concept in engineering mathematics. Although there exist a number of rules for finding the integral, it is significantly more challenging than differentiation. Moreover, in many cases, the indefinite integral does not even exist. Therefore, numerical approaches are particularly useful for integration.\", \"To illustrate the application of numerical integration, suppose that we want to calculate\", \"The Riemann sums can be quickly calculated on a computer providing a simple, yet effective approach to calculating integrals numerically. Other popular integral approximation methods include the trapezoid rule and the Simpson\'s rule.\"]}, {\"header\": \"D. Additional considerations\", \"paragraph\": [\"The above discussion about numerical methods for calculating limits, derivatives, and integrals is easily extended to multivariate calculus. For instance, to find the partial derivative f x (a, b), we can loop for k = 0 to n and calculate\", \". Many problems related to sequences and series can similarly be solved using numerical techniques. In particular, the convergence of a series can be deduced from its partial sums. By calculating the partial sums on the computer and observing the results, we can intuit the nature of the series.\", \"Vectorization is an important aspect of numerical computing. Since the modern computer chips are optimized for matrix multiplication, it is more efficient to employ vector operations. In particular, some algorithms based on for-loops can be converted into vector operations resulting in higher efficiency and speed. For instance, the Riemann sum can be calculated with a single vector operation:\", \"where x = [x 1 , ..., x n ] is the vector of endpoints, f (x) is a vectorized function operation, and S is the vector function which returns the sum of all the coordinates. Similarly, limit calculations can be vectorized and made more efficient. Vectorization is also useful in multi-variate calculus, where operations can be performed on a vector of variables. The choice of the programming language for numerical computing requires careful consideration. There are several suitable candidates for this purpose including Python, Java, C++, Matlab, and others. Based on our experience with different programming languages, we recommend the use of Python. Python is currently the most popular programming language on the planet. It has a simple and intuitive syntax making it easy to learn and apply. Python has libraries to fit any purpose including an extensive collection of libraries related to numerical computing. The basic Python libraries related to computing are NumPy, SciPy, and SymPy. More advanced packages such as OR-Tools are also available for optimization tasks. Since Python is a universal programming language, it can be used for almost any task. Thus, students who learn Python in their mathematics courses can employ it in their other courses. In addition, numerical computing implemented in Python can be connected to other applications.\", \"V. CONCLUSION Although the classical approach to teaching mathematics is still relevant for certain student cohorts, it is outdated for engineering students. Modern engineering is increasingly reliant on computing [9], [22]. Therefore, universities must equip the student with appropriate computing skills. In particular, mathematics courses must be revised to include numerical computing content.\", \"Given the efficiency of computer-based calculations, numerical computing provides a convenient approach to problem solving in engineering mathematics.

This adoption seeks, for example, to improve the engagement of developers while creating UML models or writing code. Empirical studies [7,9,14] report that UML models suffer from incompleteness and inconsistency problems. Lange [14] reinforces that these defects bring potential risks that can cause misinterpretation and communication failure, representing a risk to software quality. Thus, finding formats that favor student learning and consequently in generating increasingly effective UML models can become one of the main challenges faced by instructors that include UML (Unified Modeling Language) as part of software modeling content.\", \"Some studies [3,12,25] sought to understand how to apply gamification in software modeling teaching using some elements such as points, emblems and levels. However, instructors and researchers still find limitations when applying, evaluating, and measuring the use of this tool in the learning of software modeling students and, consequently, in the models developed by them, since in the current literature there is no \\\"frame of reference\\\" that guides them. This study conjectures that gamification mechanics can improve learner engagement while learning software modeling, mitigating such problems concerning UML models. The current literature lacks studies that explore gamification and model quality in the context of software modeling learning.\", \"This article, therefore, introduces ModelGame, which is a quality model to support software modeling learning in a gamified way. It serves as a reference framework so that instructors can obtain a parameterized way to evaluate UML models created by learners. The quality of UML models can be improved by applying gamified activities and providing guidelines aware of quality issues. A reference framework would help to (1) establish parameters for evaluating UML models created by learners; (2) provide guidelines to improve the quality of these artifacts; (3) to analyze which elements of gamification could be included in each of the phases of modeling using UML; (4) identify intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of students during the modeling stages, to improve the models; (5) to compare validated theories about the inclusion of gamification in software modeling teaching, taking into account the types of learning and methodologies used; and (6) contributing to the identification of gamification use objectives in modeling activities.\", \"A qualitative questionnaire was answered by 19 instructors who teach software modeling at higher education institutions.

Dynamicsinclude all game aspects related to the emotional responses of \\\"players\\\" (e.g., relationship, progression, and narrative).Mechanics offer elements that promote the action of a game -usually elaborated via a rule-based development -, so that the player can interact with such elements, e.g., challenges, feedback, and rewards. Components represent the aesthetic elements of gamification, whose goal is to present visual aspects with which players can perform the interaction, for example, points, scores, and emblems (badges).\", \"Knowing that the teaching of Software Engineering should involve students to experience the professional practices of the area so that they can understand which practices and techniques are useful in several different situations [2]. The challenges of teaching new software engineers are not limited to learning programming, but also include paying attention to detail, considering the quality of created models, established schedule and defined budgets [1]. In addition to understanding the technical challenges, these future professionals must be up to date with nontechnical issues, including teamwork, communication and management.\", \"To meet these new demands of the current context, the format with exhibition classes is no longer considered enough and may even become demotivating and ineffective in learning students. In this sense, gamification has been increasingly used in the teaching of software engineering as a way to promote behavioral and psychological changes [11] providing an environment that favors communication, cooperation, feedback, reward, achievement and other recurring elements that are capable of improving performance, efficiency and engagement in educational activities , and can enhance, for example, the learning of software modeling.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Software Modeling and Model Quality\", \"paragraph\": [\"Software modeling encompasses the set of principles, concepts, and practices that lead to the development of a high-quality system or product. The principles of this activity establish a philosophy that guides the entire software development process.\", \"In this scenario, UML models play a crucial role in software development tasks, for example, documenting project decisions, understanding development details, promoting better communication between teams, and generating greater efficiency in software development [19]. However, these models suffer problems of inconsistency and incompleteness [10,18], as well as end up being overlooked within the modeling process, as pointed out in some empirical studies in the literature [14,15]. Class and sequence diagrams, for example, present inconsistencies when sequence diagram objects are not found in the class diagram, consequently developers end up living with inconsistencies throughout the development process.\", \"A research challenge still open is how to evaluate these diagrams, both in industry and in the teaching process, in terms of quality, such as syntactic and semantic, for example.\"]}, {\"header\": \"RELATED WORK\", \"paragraph\": [\"The selection of related works was carried out following two steps:\", \"(1) search in digital repositories, such as Google Scholar and Scopus (Elsevier) of articles related to gamification, quality modeling, and modeling learning; and (2) filter selected articles considering the alignment of such works with the objective of the work (Section 4).

(2021) [4]. This work performed a systematic mapping with the objective of characterizing how gamification has been adopted in noneducational contexts of software engineering activities. The main results of this study show that gamification provided benefits for activities such as requirements specification, development, testing, project management, and support process. In addition, he pointed out that the number of publications and new research initiatives has increased over the years, many positive results have been achieved in software engineering activities. Nevertheless, the study reinforced that gamification can still be explored for other tasks in this area, as empirical evidence is very limited.\", \"Marin (2021) [17]. It performed the application of gamification on some topics of a software engineering course to engage students and increase their motivation and argued that, with due motivation, students can better exercise the topics and obtain more solid knowledge. There were five games related to risk management, BPMN modeling, Scrum process, design and inspection of class diagrams, and cosmic functional size measurement to assist in the learning process of the software engineering course. This study also presented the lessons learned about the application of gamification and serious games in software engineering, including limitations or disadvantages.\", \"Jurgelaitis et al. (2018) [12]. This work conducted a research to investigate how gamification could be inserted into an Information Systems Modeling course, which covers a range of topics on UML. As a result, an implementation of the gamified system modeling course in the Moodle environment was presented, using additional plugins for the use of the necessary gamified elements. The study showed good results and obtained a positive acceptance by the participating students.\", \"Rodrigues et al. (2018) [22]. They investigated the use of games and game elements in software engineering education, through a research that had the participation of 88 instructors of this discipline. The results showed that most instructors are aware of these educational approaches, however, the games were adopted by only 21 participants and game elements were adopted only by 19. Games are most often used to cover \\\"Software Process\\\" and \\\"Project Management\\\". The most commonly used game elements are points, quizzes, and challenges. The results also show that the main reasons for not adopting the resources are the lack of knowledge, information about games relevant to the engineering of teaching software, and the lack of time to plan and include these approaches in the classroom.\", \"Cosentino et al. (2017) [3]. They present a model-based approach to learning modeling in a gamified way. The approach includes a new language to model the gamification process itself and an environment where it can be incorporated into current modeling tools to allow instructors and students to design and use a complete modeling framework, including gamification elements. In addition, the approach also had as a proposal to provide support to collect and analyze gamification data, thus facilitating monitoring activities.\", \"Yohannis (2016) [25]. This research presents an exploration of game design as an approach to strengthening the student\'s mastery in software modeling by developing their abstraction skills. It brought together concepts of gamification development, such as the lens of atoms of intrinsic skill and principles of pedagogical design of various theories and models of learning. The research follows the Design Science Research Methodology and explores the best practices of Model Oriented Engineering. As a result, a modeling game design framework and generation structure and a series of produced games are presented.\", \"Pedreira et al. (2015) [21]. They developed a systematic mapping of gamification in Software Engineering based on 29 studies. The mapping revealed that software implementation is the area in which most studies focus, followed by software requirements, few others in different areas, such as project planning and software testing, and even to a lesser extent in activities involving software modeling.

The first concept presented in this study is the domain, which corresponds to a specific context of the application to be developed to solve the problem. In this process, the design template represents the solution given to the domain. Association\", \"\\u2022 contextualizes:\", \"Each contextualise refers to the domain that will serve as the basis for the challenges launched.\", \"Challenges.

Association\", \"Each influence represents that the proposed challenge interfered in aspects of the design model, causing the user to seek to make a continuous improvement.\", \"Modeling Language. Software modeling is an important step for development to happen in a way that adheres to the requirements established by the requester, for this, there is the modeling language, which offers a standardized way to document and design software. Through the use of modeling languages, it is possible to achieve a high level of understanding about the software in question, improving the communication between all those involved in the process, thus avoiding implementation errors. It points out that software engineers use these languages to communicate design decisions and verify the feasibility of implementing the intended design. The UML was consolidated as the Modeling Language in the paradigm of object orientation, in which it is possible through visual notation generated from the diagrams-presented later in this study as Design Models-to perform the representation of various perspectives of the system. Association User. This concept corresponds to the individual who performs the interpretation of the developed design models, whose objective is to be able to understand the domain in question. In the gamified context, the user has the role of player and it is he who performs the whole process, being able to perform the interpretation of existing models or even creating new ones.

There are several tools available, online and desktop, and it is up to the user to choose the one that will best meet their needs and adapt to the context in question, that is, they work in any domain that is being considered.\", \"Design Model. The design model refers to a visual notation (diagram) to represent static and dynamic aspects. These models are built according to a specific objective or task and tend to facilitate the logical interpretation of the software in several aspects. The most popular diagrams are Use Cases and Classes, the first being static and representing a set of actions generated from functional requirements (use cases) and presenting the interactions generated with external users (actors). The second is a static diagram and makes the representation of the logical structure of the software involving the classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships between them [19]. Association\", \"\\u2022 describes: Domain [1] Each describes makes the representation of a specific domain and means that every design model must describe it.\", \"Inconsistency.

Through this concept, it is possible to stimulate competition, collaboration, and creativity among users, stimulating learning. Points appear as a derivation of the association affects, since when each inconsistency error is identified or not, the user will receive a score and the association describes, because the points will also be applied when making connections between the model and the domain.\", \"Progress. The concept of progress emerges as a factor that makes the user able to perceive its evolution in the process, in this case, software modeling. Progress emerges as a derivation of the association interprets, making the user know when they have performed a correct interpretation of the proposed design model or what still needs to be improved.\", \"Feedback.

To produce design templates, users can use unusual tools such as paper, whiteboard, and more. However, most of the time they choose to use formal tools (CASES) and can be online or desktop.

Our findings can enhance the adoption of new teaching practices through gamification, resulting in the improvement of software modeling learning using UML, and consequently the creation of models developed by students. These approaches can stimulate students\' immersion in the design of systems as future professionals during learning.\", \"Finally, we hope to carry out in the future a series of experimental studies to analyze each stage of application of the ModelGame and that this work represents a first step to better support the application of empirical studies on models of evaluation of the use of gamification in software modeling.

Instead of looking at all possible combinations we can focus only on the moves that lead us to specific strategies in effect discarding meaningless moves. These strategies are selected by finding similarities to cases in the CBR database. The strategies are formed by a set of desired goals. The AI planning is responsible for creating a plan to reach these goals. The plan is basically a set of moves that brings the player to this goal. By following these steps and not regarding the vast number of other possible moves the model develops Game Trees which grows slower so they can be built with more feature moves restricted by the same amount of memory.','[{\"header\": \"Introduction\", \"paragraph\": [\"The goal of this effort is to explore a model for design and implementation of an AI agent for turn based games.

This is likely due to a fact that the investment necessary for engaging in the spamming industry is relatively low. As a result of this, we currently have a system that identifies every email as suspicious, which has caused major expenditures in the investment of defense systems [12]. Emails are used for online crimes like fraud, hacking, phishing, E-mail bombing, bullying, and spamming. [16]. Algorithms that are based on machine learning (ML) are now the most effective and often used approach to the recognition of spam. Phishing, which is defined as a fraudulent attempt to acquire private information by masquerading as a trustworthy party in electronic communication, has rapidly advanced past use of simple techniques and the tactic of casting a wide net; instead, spear phishing uses a variety of sophisticated techniques to target a single high-value individual. Other researchers used NB, Decision Trees, and SVM to compare the performance of supervised ML algorithms for spam identification [6]. Spam emails clog up recipients\' inboxes with unsolicited communications, which frustrate them and push them into the attacker\'s planned traps [7]. As a result, spam messages unquestionably pose a risk to both email users and the Internet community. In addition, Users may occasionally read the entire text of an unsolicited message that is delivered to the target users\' inboxes without realizing that the message is junk and then choosing to avoid it. Building a framework for email spam detection is the aim of this project. In this approach, we combine the Word-Embedding Network with the CNN layer, Bi-LSTM, and GRU (BiLSTM+GRU). CNN layers are used to speed up training time before the Bi-LSTM network, and more advanced textual characteristics are extracted with the use of this network in comparison to the straight LSTM network, in less time. Gated recurrent neural networks (GRUs) are then added because they train more quickly and perform better for language modeling. To evaluate and investigate various machine learning algorithms for predicting email spam, and develop a hybrid classification algorithm to filter email spam before employing an ensemble classification algorithm to forecast it. To put an innovative technique into practice and compare it to the current method in terms of various metrics. Ensemble learning, a successful machine learning paradigm, combines a group of learners rather than a single learner to forecast unknown target attributes. Bagging, boosting, voting, and stacking are the four main types of ensemble learning techniques. To increase performance, an integrated method and the combining of two or three algorithms are also suggested. Extraction of text-based features takes a long time. Furthermore, it can be challenging to extract all of the crucial information from a short text. Over the span associated with this research, we utilize Bidirectional Large Short-Term Memories (Bi-LSTM) in conjunction with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to come up with an innovative method to the detection of spam.

Cybercriminals exploit it in a number of ways, including as sending obscene or abusive messages, adding viruses to emails, snatching the private information of victims, and exposing it to a broad audience. Spam letters made up 53.95% of all email traffic in March 2020. We examine three main types of unlawful emails in our study. First are fake emails, which are sent to manipulate recipients to submit sensitive information. The second as being cyberbullying\'s use of harassing emails to threaten individuals. Suspicious emails that describe illegal activities belong to the third category. Many researchers have earlier contributed massively to this subject. The researcher claims there is some proof that suspicious emails were sent before to the events of 9/11. [14]. When it comes to data labeling, there are also convinced rule-based approaches and technologies ( like VADER) that are used, even though their efficiency of the are together is adversely affected. A hidden layer, which itself is essential for vectorization, is the top layer of the model. We use oversampling methods for this minority class because of the absence of data. Sampling techniques can help with multicollinearity, but they have an impact on simulation results. Oversampling causes data to be randomly repeated, which affects test data because dividing data may result in duplicates. Undersampling may result in the loss of some strong information. In order to advance email research, it is crucial to provide datasets on criminal activity. P. Garg et al. (2021) [5], which revealed that spam in an email was detected in 70 percent of business emails, spam was established as an obstacle for email administrators. Recognizing spam and getting rid of it were the primary concerns, as spam can be offensive, may lead to other internet sites being tricked, which can offer harmful data, and can feature those who are not particular with their content using NLP. To select the best-trained model, each mail transmission protocol requires precise and effective email classification, a machine learning comparison is done. Our study has suggested that innovative deep learning outperforms learning algorithms like SVM and RF. Current studies on the classification of emails use a variety of machine learning (ML) techniques, with a few of them focusing on the study of the sentiments consisted of within email databases. The lack of datasets is a significant obstacle to email classification. There are few publicly accessible E-mail datasets, thus researchers must use these datasets to test their hypotheses or gather data on their own. Authors [15] describe supplied two-phased outlier detection models to enhance the IIOT network\'s dependability. Artificial Neural Network, SVM, Gaussian NB, and RF (random forest) ensemble techniques were performed to forecast class labels, and the outputs were input into a classifying unit to increase accuracy. A method for content-based phishing detection was presented by the authors in [2], to classify phishing emails, they employed RF. They categorize spam and phishing emails. They enhanced phishing email classifiers with more accurate predictions by extracting features. They showed some effective Machine learning spam filtering techniques. When the PCA method is used, it will lower the number of features in the dataset. The collected features go through the PCA algorithm to reduce the number of features. The PCA method is used to make a straightforward representation of the information which illustrates the amount of variability there is in the data. The authors of [20] presented the Fuzzy C-means method for classifying spam email. To stop spam, they implemented a membership threshold value. A methodology to identify unlabeled data was put forth by the authors of [1] and applied motive analysis to the Enron data collection. They divided the data into categories that were favorable, negative, and neutral. They grouped the data using k-means clustering, an unsupervised ML technique and then classified it using the supervised ML techniques SVM and NB. Hina, Maryam, and colleagues (2021) implemented Sefaced: Deep learning-based semantic analysis and categorization of e-mail data using a forensic technique. For multiclass email classification, SeFACED employs a Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRU) based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Different random weight initializations affect LSTMs [9]. Zhang, Yan, et al.( 2019) Experiments on three-way game-theoretic rough set (GTRS) email spam filtering show that it is feasible to significantly boost coverage without decreasing accuracy [23].

[22], SMS spam has been identified using machine learning model such as naive bayes , vector-space modeling, support vector machines (SVM), long selective memory machines (LSTM), and convolutional neural networks including every instance of a method for categorizing data.

Orange software was used to create the classifications, which included Adaboost and SGD. The majority of researchers focused on text-based email spam classification methods because image-based spam can be filtered in the early stages of pre-processing. There are widely used word bag (BoW) model, which believes that documents are merely unordered collections of words, is the foundation for these techniques.

We used TF-IDF for feature extraction [20] and Textual features for spam detection were extracted using SVM and a cuckoo search algorithm. [4] for filtering out the spam email. Combining the integrated strategy to the pure SVM and NB methods, overall accuracy is really improved.

As a result of this, it may accept data from preceding time steps through LSTM as well as RNN. Therefore, in order to avoid this issue, further improvements are carried out with the help of a bidirectional recurrent neural network(Bi-RNN). BiRNN [13] can handle two pieces of information from both the front and the back. Bi-LSTM is created by combining the Bi-RNN and LSTM. As a result, operating LSTM has advantages such as cell state storage so that BiRNN have way to acknowledge from the context before and after.

The \\\"return sequences\\\" of the LSTM layer must be set to False when the subsequent state is free of the gated architecture. Quantity of learning parameters must be taken into consideration. A 350-unit LSTM layer was set -up, and different LSTM unit combinations were tested. More importantly, because it has more parts, the model made with BiLSTM will take longer to train. Bidirectional LSTM is the name of a particular kind of recurrent neural network that is primarily used for the processing of natural languages. (BiLSTM). It is able to use data from both sides, and, in contrast to regular LSTM, it enables input flow in both directions. It is an effective instrument for demonstrating the logical relationships between words and phrases, and this involves both the forward and backward directions of the sequence. In conclusion, BiLSTM works by adding one extra layer of LSTM, causing the information flow to travel in the other direction. It only denotes that the input sequence runs in reverse at the next LSTM layer. Multiple operations, including averaging, summation, multiplication, and concatenation, are then applied to the results of the two LSTM layers. The gated design of Bi-LSTM and GRU networks solves the disappearing gradient and exploding problems. A good way to handle more long sequences is to use Bi-LSMT and GRU together.

These discoveries propelled research and interest in quantum computation. Today, there exists prototype quantum hardware with computational capabilities beyond that of any classical machine [1]. Further applications of quantum theory to computation have also been made in several areas of theory of computing, such as models of computation [6], data structures [8], and cryptography [2].\", \"Quantum computation has, until today, been studied almost exclusively \'in the small.\' A general understanding of quantum computation, or, quantum programming \'in the large\' is yet to be developed. Here we aim to set the foundations of a general framework for studying, developing, and conveying quantum programs. We aim to do so by developing a universal modeling language for quantum software. Rather than develop such a language from scratch, we have decided to start from the well-known Unified Modeling Language (UML) [3], and introduce a minimum set of extensions that allow it to effectively model quantum software.\", \"Assuming UML to be a shared common-language upon which we can build, allows us to convey our original extensions much more succinctly. Our extension set can, however, be applied with little or no modification to any other modeling language.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Q-UML\", \"paragraph\": [\"Before discussing in depth the extensions we are introducing, we make a few fundamental observations on which we base the guiding principles for our extension set.\", \"Our first observation is about the nature of quantum computation. The central difference between quantum and classical computation is in how it achieves its goals. Quantum computers have access to quantum algorithms [7], and quantum data-structures [8], that are unavailable to classical computers-hence their performance advantage. Algorithms and data-structures are, however, implementation details. Algorithms are an essential design choice while programming in the small. However, they are more often than not completely ignored in large-scale software architectural design. For instance, UML diagrams seldom portray algorithms and data-structures beyond a very high-level design perspective.\", \"It would seem then that quantum computation introduces nothing to computation that needs to be captured in a software design diagram. This is not the case, and the reason for this is our second observation. Quantum computation changes the very nature of information itself. Quantum information is much richer than classical information. It is also much more challenging to store, transmit, and receive. If a module (class, object, etc.) needs to store, transmit or receive quantum information, then this is an important design consideration-which needs to be included in any effective software design.\", \"A third observation here is that the classical vs. quantum nature of the information used by a module is an important consideration both when discussing its internal implementation and its interface. Furthermore, these two are separate and independent considerations.\", \"A classical module, implementing some classical behavior, would have no need, or capability, to communicate quantum data. A quantum module may or may not have to; i.e. a module\'s quantum behavior may be completely part of its internal implementation and not appear as part of its interface. For instance, take a module implementing Shor\'s algorithm. Shor\'s algorithm uses quantum effects to efficiently factor a large integer into its prime factors. The implementation of this module must necessarily be quantum. Both the input (the large integer) and the output (the prime factors), consist of classical information. And hence, the interface of such a module can be strictly classical.\", \"More generally, we can conceive of quantum software modules that have all classical inputs and outputs (like the above example), all quantum inputs and outputs, or a mix of both. A quantum software design must address, for each individual interface element, whether it is classical input/output, or if it is quantum. In short, whether a module communicates classically or via quantum information, and whether its internal implementation requires quantum hardware are important considerations that need to be captured in a design document.\", \"The importance of such labelling should be clear. Quantum data can only be stored and transmitted with special hardware designed to do so. More importantly, from an abstract, device-independent, strictly software perspective: quantum and classical information are not interchangeable. Classical information is clone-able and admits fanout operations, while quantum information (in general) does not. On the other hand, quantum information has a much larger state-space.\", \"Finally, it is true that quantum information is strictly a super-set of classical information-and hence a quantum module can communicate any classical information it desires using a quantum interface element. We argue, however, that using a quantum interface element and messaging when classical would suffice is bad quantum software design, for the reasons stated above.\", \"In summary, the guiding principles behind any quantum software modeling language must include the following:\", \"(1) (Quantum Classes): Whenever a software module makes use of quantum information, either as part of its internal state/implementation, or as part of its interface, this must be clearly established in a design document. (3) (Quantum Supremacy): A module that has at least one quantum element is to be considered a quantum software module, otherwise it is a classical module. Quantum and classical modules should be clearly labelled as such. (4) (Quantum Aggregation): Any module that is composed of one or more quantum modules will itself be considered a quantum module, and must be labelled as such.\", \"(5) (Quantum Communication): Quantum and classical modules can communicate with each other as long as their interfaces are compatible, i.e. the quantum module has classical inputs and/or outputs that can interface with the classical module. We will argue in Sec. 2.3 how these extensions are not only necessary, but also sufficient in order to design and represent quantum software. First, in the following two sections we put these principles into practice as a set of concrete extensions to UML.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Class Diagram Extensions\", \"paragraph\": [\"UML is a very graphical language, meant to convey a lot of meaning in a very small amount of space. As such, it makes sense to use a graphical way to represent quantum software elements. We chose to do this by use of bold text to denote quantum elements, and double lines to denote a quantum relationship or quantum communication. For attributes, the name will be bold if it is represented using quantum information. For methods, we use the following convention. If any of the inputs are quantum, these are bold. If the output or datatype of the method is quantum, then the datatype should also be bold. For backwards compatibility with regular UML, whenever the input or output datatypes of a method are omitted, these will be assumed to be classical in nature. If a class/object has any quantum attributes or methods then it itself is considered quantum, and its name shall also be bold.\", \"Relationships between classes will use double-lines whenever the relationship is quantum in nature. For inheritance, if the superclass is quantum then the subclass, and the inheritance relationship, will also be quantum. (the converse is not necessarily true however). In the case of aggregation and composition, if a class/object being aggregated/composed is quantum, then the class/object to which it is aggregated/composed into, as well as that relationship will also be quantum. Association relationships do not have any special rules, beyond the need of a quantum class/object to have a classical interface if it is to associate with classical classes/objects. Fig. 1 showcases a Q-UML diagram that exemplifies the above rules.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Sequence Diagram Extensions\", \"paragraph\": [\"Sequence diagrams in UML allow us to portray the dynamic relationship between modules in a software program. As we did before for static relationships, we extend the existing language in order to allow us to differentiate between classical and quantum messages. As previously discussed, this is essential information. Quantum information behaves differently from classical information; it can store/portray different data; it admits different operations; and, it requires different hardware to store, send, and receive. Like before, we make use of bold text to markup quantum modules, and double lines to portray quantum messages. Fig. 2 shows a Q-UML sequence diagram. Note how even though the relationship between Shorfactor and ShorOrder is quantum, the messaging between them is not. This illustrates an important point. A module is marked as quantum if it uses quantum resources in any form, either directly as part of its internal implementation or as part of an aggregated module. If a sub-module (in UML a composed class or object) is quantum, then the encompassing module must also be marked as quantum. In a static (e.g. class) diagram, the quantum composition relationships inform us-especially in the case of a seemingly classical module that does not in itself use quantum resources-which composed modules are using quantum resources.\", \"Also, note the communication between the objects ShorOrder and QFT_n. The module QFT_n operates on a quantum state. Hence, both \'set\' messages are quantum. Likewise, the return messages \\u03c1 and \\u03c1 are quantum states. However, the request to perform a quantum Fourier transform (QFT) or a QFT inverse operation can (and therefore should) be communicated classically.

We exemplify our additions in UML, but these extensions are easily applicable to any other modeling language, or be used as the basis for a new modeling language.\", \"We\'ve argued the necessity of each of the extensions in previous sections. We can argue as well, that these extensions are not only necessary, but also sufficient to fully model quantum software. To make this argument, we appeal to the fact that all quantum computation is simulable using classical computation albeit with an efficiency loss. Other than their use of quantum information and algorithms, quantum computers are indistinct from classical ones. Hence, from a high-level design perspective, the only information element that needs to be considered when developing quantum software is when quantum (rather than classical) information is being used.\", \"The one remaining information element we have not discussed is algorithm efficiency. If quantum computation is to be used, it will most likely be due to the efficient algorithms at its disposal. That said, algorithm efficiency is not a solely quantum consideration. UML itself does not inherently have language elements for algorithm efficiency (beyond user-defined notes). It does, however, have several extensions used and proposed for this purpose(see e.g. [4]). Other modeling languages may also have definite algorithm efficiency elements.

This approach to user interaction misses an opportunity for users to more deeply engage with the model by having the context of their previous interactions, as well as the context of their code, inform the model\'s responses.

Collaborative software engineering is especially promising, given that professional software development is rarely a solo activity and relevant knowledge and expertise are typically distributed widely within an organization [68]. Many efforts have focused on incorporating collaborative technologies into software development environments (e.g. [8,25,26,58,101]).\", \"The pioneering work of Rich and Waters on The Programmer\'s Apprentice [70] presented a novel concept of a knowledgeable automated assistant -in effect, an artificial collaborative partner -that could help software engineers with writing code, designing software systems, and creating requirements specifications.

In the intervening years, an increase in computational power, the availability of large corpora of language and code data, and the development of deep neural networks have made new approaches to achieving their goals worth exploring.\", \"Recently, models leveraging the transformer architecture [96] have been developed to perform domain-specific software engineering tasks, such as translating code between languages [75], generating documentation for code [36,38,97,98], and generating unit tests for code [92] (see Talamadupula [90] and Allamanis et al.

The Codex model [24] was then produced by finetuning GPT-3 on a large corpus of source code data, leading to the development of Copilot [32], a tool that helps software engineers by autocompleting code as it is being written. Experimentation with Copilot has shown its ability to perform additional tasks, such as explaining code, generating documentation, and translating code between languages [6].\", \"Although autocompletion interfaces are useful and valuable when the system can discern the developer\'s intent, there are many instances where that is insufficient.

They may even have general programming questions that need to be answered before they are able to write any code.\", \"In this paper, we seek to understand whether modern developments in code-fluent foundation models -large language models that have been fine-tuned on source code data -are sufficient to support a conversational agent that can act as an assistant in the software development process.

These models are probabilistic systems, and as such, do not always produce perfect results (e.g. code that is free of syntax or logical errors). Nonetheless, Weisz et al. [102] found that software engineers are still interested in using such models in their work, and that the imperfect outputs of these models can even help them produce higher-quality code via human-AI collaboration [103]. New tools based on code-fluent LLMs are actively being developed. GitHub Copilot1 is described as \\\"Your AI pair programmer. \\\" It is optimized for the code autocompletion use case: given a starting snippet such as a method\'s documentation, signature, or partial implementation, Copilot completes the implementation.

In \\\"exploration mode,\\\" however, the interaction was more awkward. Developers would communicate with Copilot by typing comments and seeing what Copilot generated in response. Then, they would modify their comments to explore other ways of prompting a response. Ultimately, the comments used to prompt the model would be deleted after the relevant code was generated, indicating that their value was largely in driving a back-and-forth, yet context free, dialog with the model to coerce it to produce the desired results through an iterative refinement process.

One limitation stemmed from the fact that the model sometimes produced incorrect responses (e.g. code with syntax errors), incomplete responses (e.g. code that was missing functionality), irrelevant responses (e.g. responses not related to the user\'s question), or insubstantial responses (e.g. \\\"I don\'t know\\\"). Because of the probabilistic nature of model inference, re-prompting the model would sometimes produce a more correct or appropriate response. Thus, we added the ability for users to \\\"try again, \\\" either by asking in the chat or by clicking a button in the UI (Figure 1C). This feature removes the assistant\'s last response from the context presented to the model and then re-invokes the model with an increased temperature 10 .\", \"Although it is possible for transformer models such as Codex to produce multiple possible responses to a single prompt, we only request a single response in order to speed up response time as well as to preserve the token budget for conversational context. Thus, the \\\"try again\\\" feature provides an alternate way to produce a wider variety of responses.\", \"During pilot testing, we noticed that the assistant sometimes happened to generate the same response to multiple, unrelated requests. In these cases, the assistant tended to get \\\"stuck\\\" in a pattern of repeating the same response and was unable to resume normal conversation. To avoid this problem, we automatically execute a The \\\"try again\\\" button (C) allows users to ask the assistant to generate an alternate response to the most recent question. The \\\"start over\\\" button (D) resets the conversational context for the assistant, but maintains the chat transcript in the UI. In this example, we show the assistant introduce itself to the user (E). Next, the user asks a general programming question (F), for which the assistant provides an inline code response (G). The user then asks a question about code selected in the editor (H), followed by a series of follow-up questions.\", \"\\\"try again\\\" operation in the background when we see identical consecutive responses from the assistant. Finally, we noticed that the accumulation of conversational context sometimes resulted in the assistant becoming fixated on some portion of the earlier conversation. For example, it might respond to a question with portions of the prompt or of earlier conversation, and become less responsive to newer requests. To address this issue, we introduced a \\\"start over\\\" feature, accessible via the chat or by clicking a button in the UI (Figure 1D), that resets the context to the original prompt, forgetting the rest of the conversational history. We preserve the chat transcript in the UI, but delineate the break in the assistant\'s memory with an annotation in the chat transcript.

We designed these challenges to expose participants to a broad range of the assistant\'s capabilities. For each of these challenges, we explicitly did not evaluate metrics such as the participant\'s productivity, the quality of their solutions, or the time taken to produce them, as the focus of our study was to understand the utility of conversational interaction. We selected Python as the language used for the tutorial and challenges because of its general popularity [21] and the fact that it was well-supported by our underlying LLM [24].\", \"4.1.1 Tutorial. All participants were first introduced to the Programmer\'s Assistant through a tutorial. The tutorial walked each participant through 10 sample interactions to give them a feeling for what the assistant could do and how to interact with it. The tutorial demonstrated how to ask questions, how to request code to be generated, and how to evaluate existing code. It did not specifically cover how to generate documentation or unit tests. Tutorial instructions were provided within the code editor. We include the specific text used for the tutorial in Appendix B.\", \"4.1.2 Programming Challenges.

Nine NCF categories -Acknowledgment, Apology, Confirmation, Expression of Gratitude, Farewell, Greeting, Self-Identification, Welfare Check, and Welfare Report -appeared twice in our codebook to distinguish cases in which the utterance was made by the human participant vs. the assistant. Other NCF categories were split to provide nuanced detail about the interaction; for example, we distinguished three different kinds of NCF requests, depending upon whether they were stated as Requests for Action (e.g. codes to identify meta-information such as utterances that included code, utterances that referenced selected code, utterances that implicitly or explicitly referenced earlier portions of the conversation, or non-verbal UI activities such as copies, pastes, and invocations of \\\"try again\\\" and \\\"start over. \\\" Finally, we classified a subset of the human-applied codes based on whether they represented a participant\'s task or social orientation toward the assistant. We list our codes in Table 1, but note that not all of them ended up being relevant to our analysis. When coding conversational data, we applied individual codes at the level of each conversational utterance. We allowed multiple codes to be applied to each utterance to account for utterances that performed multiple functions (e.g. greeting and self-identification). In order to ensure consistency in how our codebook was applied, two authors coded a 10% sample of the 968 conversational exchanges, achieving a satisfactory level of inter-rater reliability (Krippendorf\'s \\ud835\\udefc = 0.77, where agreement was conservatively defined as having all of the same codes applied to both utterances in a conversational exchange).\"]}, {\"header\": \"Expectations and Experience\", \"paragraph\": [\"Pilot testing of the Programmer\'s Assistant suggested that software engineers would be skeptical of a conversational programming assistant and its ability to provide useful assistance.

This skepticism motivated us to develop the Programmer\'s Assistant in order to evaluate whether the conversational experience, as powered by a state-ofthe-art code-fluent LLM, would be better than people had anticipated. During pilot testing, we received feedback that the Programmer\'s Assistant provided a much better conversational experience compared to testers\' previous experiences with chatbots. Thus, in designing our study, we felt it important to first gauge participants\' expectations of a conversational interaction around code, and then measure their experience after the fact.\", \"We developed a short inventory of six scale items to measure user experience of code work 15 .

One of the challenges in interpreting participants\' comments about the utility of the Programmer\'s Assistant was in disentangling the extent to which value was derived from the quality of the underlying model versus the integration of conversation in a code context. Indeed, participants felt that the chat interaction was valuable: 69.0% of participants felt that eliminating the conversational interaction and making the assistant behave more like web search would decrease its value. Further, our analysis of the conversation transcripts revealed that 42% of the 910 task-oriented utterances from participants required historical conversational context (Chat Context Required) in order to be correctly interpreted.

One specific benefit of the Programmer\'s Assistant identified by participants is its ability to help people improve their programming skills and reinforce knowledge gaps. For example, it can help users \\\"remember how to do things in certain languages... such as, when I am using a language I haven\'t used in a while\\\" (P9). The assistant can also serve as an memory aid, such as when \\\"I use a lot of libraries that I don\'t always remember all of the functions\\\" (P15).

I have a feeling this would cut that time down from weeks to a day or so. \\\" (P1) P39 also identified the fact that, because the interactions with the assistant are conversational, it forces people to learn how to communicate to others about their code: \\\"The conversation aspect promotes proper communication, which would really stand to benefit budding programmers if they want to learn how to explain concepts more fluently in the future to their colleagues.\\\" (P39) Conversely, P36 suggested that over-reliance on programming assistance might have a detrimental effect to one\'s learning: \\\"It\'s definitely a huge time saver, but over-reliance on it may cause new developers to skip learning the reference material themselves and discovering new things and sparking new ideas. \\\" (P36) 5.3.4 Trust. Many participants raised questions about whether they could trust the responses provided by the Programmer\'s Assistant. P21 asked this question most directly: \\\"will the code be correct, safe, efficient?\\\" Other participants raised similar questions, such as, \\\"I\'m wondering how it validates it\'s answers, if it can be trusted to always give a working answer\\\" (P10), and \\\"Sometimes lack of source and context may raise doubts in the mind of the programmer\\\" (P16).\", \"These issues of trust were exacerbated by the fact that the Programmer\'s Assistant did not allow participants to actually run their code. Because of this limitation, participants had to rely on their own knowledge to judge the correctness of the assistant\'s responses. P19 asserted, \\\"There is no way to evaluate if the Programmer\'s assistant is giving you the right advise or not other than your own knowledge, \\\" and P9 concurred: \\\"I had to trust that it was correct (and use my own prior knowledge). \\\"\", \"P18 described the potential consequences of allowing the assistant to write code for them:\", \"\\\"The only thing that made me nervous was that it could have introduced a bug that wasn\'t immediately apparent. And given I didn\'t write the code, I could have easily glossed over a mistake when reviewing it. Especially if it is also the one writing the test cases. \\\" (P18)\", \"Despite our efforts to make the Programmer\'s Assistant respond in non-authoritative ways, we did observe participants sometimes uncritically accept generated results that were clearly wrong or incomplete. Thus, we did find behavioral evidence for over-reliance.\", \"Listing 2: Building trust through explanations and justifications One way to address trust issues is for the assistant to provide further explanations and justifications that can calibrate a user\'s confidence in the assistant\'s responses. Such explanations could be requested conversationally, though most participants did not attempt to do so. One participant (P9) did ask for such explanations, and we show a summary of their transcript in Listing 2. In this instance, P9 asked for a definition of a unit test (line 1), an explanation of the code being tested (line 25), and justifications of the quality of the unit test (lines 31& 37). Thus, we observe that the assistant is capable of producing explanations and justifications when asked.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Patterns of Interaction and Mental Models\", \"paragraph\": [\"Participants interacted with the assistant in a variety of ways with two main patterns of usage standing out: (1) invoking the assistant to solve the entire programming challenge, and (2) breaking the challenge down into a set of smaller tasks and invoking the assistant\'s help for each.

Although participants strongly saw the role of the assistant as being a tool, their behaviors revealed that in many cases, they actually treated it as a social agent. In addition, participants ascribed various mental capacities to the assistant, such as having the ability to understand, compute, and learn.\", \"Participants felt the assistant changed the nature of their work process. For some participants, it enabled them to focus on the higher-level aspects of development because the assistant handled lower-level details or provided partial solutions for them to build upon.

They felt that the conversational style of interaction enabled them to discover new, emergent behaviors from the model that were unavailable from Copilot\'s focus on code autocompletion. They also felt that the examples provided by the assistant were more readily usable within their own code compared to browsing for answers within search results, speeding up the coding process.

Some participants would present the entire challenge description to the assistant and then work with the results it produced. Other participants approached the programming challenges in a piecemeal fashion, breaking them apart into a set of smaller tasks, then invoking the assistant to aid with each one.\", \"Experience with Python was not a determinant of how participants approached the programming challenges, but it did seem to impact how participants interacted with the assistant. Less experienced participants tended to ask the assistant basic questions such as, \\\"What is a unit test\\\" (P29, not familiar with Python) and \\\"how do I document a function?\\\" (P27, < 1 year of experience). More experienced participants made detailed requests about specific Python libraries or algorithms, such as, \\\"given a pandas dataframe with two columns \'Date\' and \'Sales\' please use matplotlib to draw me a scatterplot\\\" (P38, 3+ years of experience) and \\\"implement a rungekutta algorithm for solving an ODE with adaptive time steps\\\" (P37, 3+ years of experience).\", \"Another difference we observed in how people interacted with the assistant stemmed from their view on the role it played in their collaborative process. Some participants, such as P18, treated it more as a tool by issuing commands rather than asking questions. As quoted earlier, they said, \\\"I didn\'t converse with it like a chat bot. \\\" P5 described their interaction style similarly: \\\"I found myself wanting to type search queries into Socrates, not treating it as a person but as a search tool. \\\"\", \"In anticipation that participants would have different orientations to the assistant and its role, we asked a question on the posttask survey about the different kinds of roles the assistant might take. These roles generally fell into one of two categories: a tool orientation (a tool, a reference guide, a content generator, a problem solver), and a social orientation (a collaborator, a colleague, a coach, an advisor, a reviewer). Participants rated the extent to which they viewed the Programmer\'s Assistant in each of these roles on a 4point scale of extent: Not at all (1), A little (2), Somewhat (3), or A great deal (4).  We show participants\' ratings of the assistant\'s role in Figure 3. Despite the fact that their attitudes toward the assistant overwhelmingly reflected a tool orientation, their behaviors reveal that many participants actually treated the assistant as a social agent. P6 described how \\\"I felt it like a partner,\\\" and P4 told the assistant, \\\"I could not have solved [the challenge] without your help,\\\" to which the assistant responded, \\\"I\'m glad I could help. \\\"\", \"The literature on Computers as Social Agents (CASA) helps us interpret this result as it demonstrates how computers are often treated like people [56,67]. LLM-based conversational agents can exacerbate this tendency; as they likely have been trained on examples of social interaction, they can also respond as social agents.\", \"In the conversation logs, we identified participants who interacted with the assistant in a socially-oriented fashion (the social orientation codes in Table 1). Twenty participants (47.6%) made at least one socially-oriented utterance. An extreme form of this interaction style can be seen in a snippet from P6\'s transcript (Listing 3).\", \"The 20 participants with a behaviorally-demonstrated social orientation did not generally differ in their role ratings from other participants, except that they rated the assistant as more likely to be an advisor (Fisher\'s exact test, two-tailed \\ud835\\udc5d = .02) or a reviewer (Fisher\'s exact test, two-tailed \\ud835\\udc5d = .03). However, they did not differ in their overwhelmingly-strong ratings of the tool orientations.

P37 remarked that, \\\"It opens a whole new door for fast develpment. \\\" P4 discussed how the assistant \\\"was helpful in staying focused on the code, \\\" although for P14, \\\"it took [me] time to get into tempo with the tool. \\\"\", \"P31 pointed out how the assistant would change the nature of their work: \\\"My job could focus more on higher level aspects and therefore achieving better (quality) results, besides the time-to-value...

P5 aptly described this process: \\\"It\'s nice to copy well formulated challenges in natural language and have the code generator take its best stab at it, then edit to our hearts content. \\\" (P5)\", \"Participants felt that human review of the assistant\'s responses was necessary because \\\"The answers provided are generally not novel solutions, often look clunky and non-elegant. There may be some unnecessary code. Basically the code would need to be reviewed\\\" (P16).

We also asked a similar question to compare the assistant with another popular form of programming assistance, searching the web (via a search engine like Google, or a Q&A site like Stack Overflow). In discussing the differences between these three tools, we note that the primary differentiator is their interaction model.\", \"The interaction model for the Programmer\'s Assistant is clearly conversational: users ask questions in natural language and are provided with a response in natural language and/or code. The interaction model of Copilot is reminiscent of direct manipulation interfaces [37], in which the user\'s actions in the user interface directly manipulate an object on the screen. Copilot automatically makes autocompletion suggestions as the user types. This autocompleted code is directly placed in the source editor; thus, the user\'s work is contained entirely within the scope of the object on which they are working (i.e. the source code), which is how direct manipulation interfaces operate. In web search, users enter a separate search context (e.g. a search engine accessed within a web browser), type in a natural language query, and then forage amongst search results to identify relevant items of interest [12,62].\", \"When a desirable item is found, users must translate it into their code environment (e.g. via copy/paste) and possibly edit it to fit their existing code.\", \"We also note that the Programmer\'s Assistant and Copilot both utilize the same underlying AI model, Codex [24], which means that the only difference between these tools is the user experience. The extent to which Codex was trained on data from programmingrelated Q&A web sites is less clear, but for the purposes of our analysis, we focus our discussion solely on the differences in their interaction models 16 .\", \"Participants reported various benefits and drawbacks of a conversational interaction over a direct manipulation interaction. Foremost, conversation \\\"felt very natural\\\" (P21) and \\\"feels much more natural using Natural Language with the AI\\\" (P39). In addition, P39 felt that \\\"the use cases of Programmers\' Assistant seem more openended. \\\" Many participants were surprised at the variety of tasks the assistant was capable of performing, from writing unit tests (P19, P36, P37) and documentation (P12, P19, P36, P37) to explaining what code did (P31, P38) and even answering general-knowledge questions (P31). Again, we note that the Programmer\'s Assistant utilizes the same underlying model as Copilot, yet the conversational interface was able to expose a wider variety of emergent behaviors from the model. Multiple participants explored the limits of the assistant\'s knowledge and abilities beyond our programming challenges. For example, P37 asked it questions about physics and ordinary differential equations (\\\"ODe\\\" as written by P37), and was surprised by the \\\"versatility of what it could answer. \\\" \\\"I asked it some physics and ODe question and the answers, though not complete, included the key parts needed to write that code. \\\" (P37) P31 probed the assistant on its knowledge of geography and was surprised when the assistant produced a correct answer.\", \"\\\"I asked something out of SW engineering domain (geography) and it replied correctly, also by correctly answering on my nationality. \\\" (P31) For some participants, the ability to assess the assistant\'s response before committing to it (i.e. by inserting assistant-generated code into their editor) was a boon. P15 described how the copy/paste boundary provided them with \\\"a bit more control to ask specific questions about what I wanted and to assess before putting it in my code.\\\" Other participants felt that the copy/paste boundary was more inefficient: \\\"I think the main difference is the ability of Copilot to suggest code while you type, what make it faster and easier to use. While using the Programmer\'s Assistant, you need to go to the chat, ask the question, copy the code (or rephrase the question if it was not understood by the agent), and edit it to match your code. \\\" (P3) A large number of participants felt that the conversational interaction was faster than web search (P1, P6, P7, P10, P11, P12, P16, P17, P18, P20, P24, P29, P30, P33, P36, P37, P42) because of its ability to provide \\\"real-time responses\\\" (P32) that can be \\\"applied exactly to your code\\\" (P33) without having to \\\"parse through lots of text... to get what you need\\\" (P15). In addition, the assistant provided \\\"MUCH faster, better responses\\\" (P17) that were \\\"much more relevant to the problems\\\" (P34) and \\\"simple [and] succinct\\\" (P9), without having to \\\"sort through answers on your own or read documentation\\\" (P9) or \\\"look at many posts before finding the relevant one\\\" (P18).\", \"Despite these benefits, some participants felt that the assistant might not work well for \\\"more specific and difficult problems on a bigger scale\\\" as compared to web search. P9 felt that \\\"the data [of the Programmer\'s Assistant] wasn\'t as rich\\\" as the web. Other participants felt that the assistant lacked the \\\"multiple answers\\\" (P9) and \\\"rich social commentary\\\" (P19) that accompanies answers on Q&A sites: \\\"I like to see the different versions proposed on stack overflow and the commentary of what makes one solution better than another in a given situation. \\\" (P27) Some participants promoted a more balanced view that there isn\'t a single mode of interaction superior to all others. P19 felt that web search would be a fallback when the assistant failed to answer a question. P39 described how search could be integrated with the conversational interaction:\", \"\\\"I think both options should exist: people should be able to input their queries like a search bar AND also give their question as if in conversation. \\\" (P39)\"]}, {\"header\": \"DISCUSSION\", \"paragraph\": []}, {\"header\": \"Value of Conversational Interaction\", \"paragraph\": [\"We began our research by asking the question of whether contemporary developments in code-fluent LLMs could sufficiently support a conversational programming assistant. We believe that our work has demonstrated that they can. Clearly, the Programmer\'s Assistant was viewed by our participants as a useful tool that provided real value -so much so that many participants explicitly requested or expressed the desire to use it in their own work. However, how much of this value was derived from the model itself and its ability to produce high-quality responses to programming questions, versus from participants\' ability to conduct extended conversational interactions grounded in their actual source code?\", \"We believe that both of these constituent aspects were valuable. Indeed, many participants commented on their surprise and satisfaction with the quality of the assistant\'s responses (Section 5.2.3). However, participants also valued the conversational interactions that they had with the assistant. In the event logs, we saw evidence that participants were leveraging conversational context to ask follow-up questions as well as leveraging code context by asking about their code selections (Section 5.3.2). Many participants reported that they would find the tool less valuable if the conversational interaction were removed (Section 5.3.2). Further, conversation seemed to provide unique value beyond other interaction models (direct manipulation and search) because of its embeddedness in the UI and its ability to surface emergent behaviors of the model (Section 5.4.4).\", \"We do not believe that these different interaction models are in competition and we agree with P39\'s assessment that assistive tools can be built using a plethora of different interaction models. For use cases in which a model is known to produce high-quality results (e.g. code autocompletion for Codex), a direct manipulation interface seems wholly appropriate as it would provide a discoverable and predictable way of invoking the model to produce a known type of result. However, direct manipulation interfaces may be less ideal for surfacing the emergent behaviors of a foundation model [14], and thus natural language interaction may be more suitable. Many popular text-to-image models, such as DALL-E 2 [66] and Stable Diffusion [72], operate in a one-shot fashion, in which the user specifies a prompt, clicks a button, and gets results. Our study demonstrates how the additional contextual layers of conversational history and the artifact-under-development provide additional value to the co-creative process.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Toward Human-AI Synergy\", \"paragraph\": [\"The aim of human-centered AI is to \\\"enable[] people to see, think, create, and act in extraordinary ways, by combining potent user experiences with embedded AI methods to support services that users want\\\" [82]. Building upon this definition, Rezwana and Maher [69] posit that, \\\"In a creative collaboration, interaction dynamics, such as turn-taking, contribution type, and communication, are the driving forces of the co-creative process. Therefore the interaction model is a critical and essential component for effective co-creative systems.\\\" [69]. They go on to note that, \\\"There is relatively little research about interaction design in the co-creativity field, which is reflected in a lack of focus on interaction design in many existing co-creative systems. \\\"\", \"Our study begins to address this gap. While many co-creative systems examine casual tasks or experimental activities (e.g., Spoto and Oleynik [87]), our focus was on the co-creative practice of programming. Our goal was to understand peoples\' attitudes toward a conversational programming assistant, akin to Wang et al.\'s examination of data scientists\' attitudes toward automated data science technologies [99]. We found that, despite an initial level of skepticism, participants felt that a conversational assistant would provide value by improving their productivity (Section 5.4.3). However, further work is needed to assess the extent to which this type of assistance provides measurable productivity increases.\", \"Campero et al. [19] conducted a survey of papers published in 2021 that examined human-AI synergy, the notion that a human-AI team can accomplish more by working together than either party could accomplish working alone. They found mixed results, with no clear consensus emerging on how to design human-centered AI systems that can guarantee positive synergy. Summarizing from their discussion, \\\"Perhaps achieving substantial synergies among people and computers is harder than many people think. Perhaps it requires... new ways of configuring groups that include people and computers. And perhaps it needs more systematic, focused attention from researchers than it has, so far, received. \\\" [19, p.9] We believe such evaluations of human-AI synergy should go beyond one-shot performance measures. As implied by many of the uses cases listed by Seeber et al. [80], human-centered AI systems are often deployed in socio-organizational contexts that require longitudinal use [20,41,43], such as product design [93], game design [4], and engineering [20,Section 3.2.2]. Thus, we would expect that over time and through interaction with each other, human-AI teams would improve their performance through a mutual learning process.\", \"Evidence for this process surfaced in our study when participants described how they could improve their programming skills by interacting with the assistant (Section 5.3.3). We assert that the learning should operate in both directions: not only should people improve their programming skills, but the model itself can also improve based on peoples\' interactions with it. For example, when the assistant provides a code example to the user, and the user takes that example and edits it, those edits constitute feedback that can be used to further fine-tune the model. In addition, through longitudinal use, we believe that human and AI partners can create reciprocal representations of one another -i.e., the human is likely to create a mental model of the AI, and the AI may be engineered to develop a user model for each of its human users [30,48,79]. Such a pair of models is often described as Mutual Theory of Mind [29,100]. This type of capability raises the possibility of personalizing and adapting an assistant to the strengths and needs of individual users.\", \"With such models, an assistant that knows a user is learning a programming language could provide natural language explanations alongside code outputs, whereas an assistant that knows a user is strongly skilled in a programming language might shorten or omit those explanations. Similarly, users are likely to update their mental models of the AI with more experience. We believe the space for exploring how these reciprocal models impact human-AI synergy is rich, and we encourage additional work in this area.\", \"Human-centered AI systems that are designed to combine and synergize the distinct skills of humans and AI models cannot succeed if they diminish the human skills upon which they depend. Well-designed human-centered AI systems develop new and complementary skills for both the human and AI constituents [82,83], and we believe that mutual learning may address concerns that the wide deployment and use of AI systems will result in a de-skilling of the workforce [77,108].\", \"Ultimately, the design decisions that go into an interactive AI system have ethical implications. Our design attempts to augment the user\'s knowledge and skills by presenting help on demand, couched in non-authoritative suggestions, which leaves the user firmly in control and ultimately responsible for the work product.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Opportunities for Future Research\", \"paragraph\": [\"Our work highlights many interesting avenues for future enhancements that could be made to LLM-based conversational assistants such as our Programmer\'s Assistant, as well as future humancentered research on LLM-based conversational assistance.\", \"Our work employed a code-fluent model that was not specifically designed to handle conversational interaction. Fine-tuning the underlying LLM for conversational interaction, such as what has been done with Lamda [91], is one opportunity to improve the assistant\'s performance. Another opportunity is to align the language model to follow the desiderata proposed by Askell et al. [11] and described by Ouyang et al. as, \\\"helpful (they should help the user solve their task), honest (they shouldn\'t fabricate information or mislead the user), and harmless (they should not cause physical, psychological, or social harm to people or the environment)\\\" [61, p.2]. Glaese et al. [33] propose a slightly different desiderata of \\\"correct\\\" instead of \\\"honest, \\\" which may be more applicable to the software engineering domain, as the ability to produce correct code and correct answers about code are both important properties of a conversational programming assistant.\", \"Combining LLMs with search-based approaches to establish additional context for the model, such as AlphaCode [44] has done, may also result in more capable systems. These \\\"searches\\\" need not be limited to textual sources, but could be conducted over appropriate semantic stores (e.g. a knowledge graph) and take advantage of explicit semantic reasoning services, resulting in an integration of symbolic and neural approaches. Further, allowing for \\\"internal deliberation\\\" of the type shown in Nye et al. [59] could result in better-reasoned results, as well as better explanations and justifications.\", \"Another avenue for improvement involves the prompt used to configure the assistant (Appendix D). Just as the prompt for each successive interaction is modified by the growth of the conversational transcript, there is no requirement that the initial prompt be static. It too can be specialized to incorporate aspects of a user model, enabling the realization of a Mutual Theory of Mind [29,100]. Providing better UX affordances for visualizing and manipulating the active contexts -code and conversation -could provide users with more control over which information contributes to the generation of the assistant\'s response.\", \"Our participants clearly indicated that they were interested in having an assistant that behaved more proactively, in contrast to our deliberate design of an assistant that never takes conversational initiative. A more proactive assistant would be able to interrupt or remind a user when necessary [23], yet this characteristic raises many challenging issues. How can we calibrate the threshold for such interruptions? How can users tune the assistant to deliver only those interruptions that the they would find useful (e.g., [28,81])? How can we help users to regain their prior context after dealing with an interruption (e.g. [89])? Should an assistant be used to persuade or nudge the user (e.g. [35])? Who should determine the topic, frequency, and insistence of such persuasion attempts (e.g. [52,85])? Should users have the ability to moderate or defeat attempted persuasions, or should those decisions be left to the organization?\", \"Finally, we explored the different kinds of role orientations our participants had toward the assistant and found that participants varied in their views of it as a tool versus a social agent (e.g. collaborator or colleague). We posit that peoples\' effectiveness in working with an AI system may be influenced by their role orientation, and we encourage future research in this area.\"]}, {\"header\": \"CONCLUSION\", \"paragraph\": [\"We developed a prototype system, the Programmer\'s Assistant, in order to assess the utility of a conversational assistant in a software engineering context. The assistant was implemented using a stateof-the-art code-fluent large language model, Codex [24], and was capable of generating both code and natural language responses to user inquiries. We further used the prompting mechanism of the model to set up a conversational interaction in which the model uses the conversational history, plus the user\'s current utterance, in order to generate a response. In this way, users are able to ask follow-up questions in the chat that reference prior utterances and responses. We incorporated the conversational assistant into a code editing environment, enabling the conversation to be grounded in the context of the user\'s source code.\", \"We evaluated this system with 42 participants with varied levels of programming skill, and their quantitative and qualitative feedback, coupled with their usage of the system, demonstrated the varied, and sometimes emergent, types of assistance it was able to provide.

In this paper, we study this issue with articles related to the Covid-19 anti-vaccine movement. First, to understand the perspectives used to treat this theme, we developed a protocol for human labeling of frames for 1786 headlines of No-Vax movement articles of European newspapers from 5 countries.

The progress made in NLP has been gradually integrated into the journalistic field [5][8] [54]. More specifically, machine learning models based on transformers have been integrated in the media sector in different tasks [41] such as the creation of headlines with generative languages models [17], summarization of news articles [28] [27], false news detection [49], and topic modeling and sentiment analysis [25]. The development of large language models such as GPT-3 [9], BLOOM [51] or ChatGPT show a clear trend towards human-machine interaction becoming easier and more intuitive, opening up a wide range of research possibilities. At the same time, the use of these models is also associated with a lack of transparency regarding how these models work, but efforts are being made to bring some transparency to these models, and to analyze use cases where they can be useful and where they cannot [35]. Based on the premises that these models open up a wide range of research directions [7], and that at the same time (and needless to say) they are not the solution to all problems, we are interested in identifying use cases and tasks where they can be potentially useful, while acknowledging and systematically documenting their limitations [56]. More specifically, the aim of this work is to analyze the performance of GPT-3.5 for a specific use case, namely the analysis of frames in news, from an empirical point of view, with the objective of shedding light on a potential use of generative models in journalistic tasks.\", \"Frame analysis is a concept from journalism, which consists of studying the way in which news stories are presented on an issue, and what aspects are emphasized: Is a merely informative vision given in an article? Or is it intended to leave a moral lesson? Is a news article being presented from an economic point of view? Or from a more human, emotional angle? The examples above correspond to different frames with which an article can be written.\", \"The concept of news framing has been studied in computing as a step beyond topic modeling and sentiment analysis, and for this purpose, in recent years, pre-trained language models have been used for fine-tuning the classification process of these frames [60] [10], but the emergence of generative models opens the possibility of doing prompt-engineering of these classification tasks, instead of the fine-tuning approach investigated so far.\", \"Our work aims to address this research gap by posing the following research questions:\", \"RQ1: What are the main frames in the news headlines about the anti-vaccine movement, as reported in newspapers across 5 European countries? RQ2: Can prompt engineering be used for classification of headlines according to frames? By addressing the above research questions, our work makes the following contributions: Contribution 1. We implemented a process to do human annotation of the main frame of 1786 headlines of articles about the Covid-19 no-vax movement, as reported in 19 newspapers from 5 European countries (France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom.) At the headline level, we found that the predominant frame was human interest, where this frame corresponds to a personification of an event, either through a statement by a person, or the explanation of a specific event that happened to a person. Furthermore, we found a large number of headlines annotated as containing no frame, as they simply present information without entering into evaluations. We also found that for all the countries involved, the distribution of frame types was very similar, i.e., human interest and no frame are the two predominant frames. Finally, the generated annotations allowed to subsequently study the performance of a large language model. Contribution 2. We studied the performance of GPT-3.5 on the task of frame classification of headlines. In addition to using the fine-tuning approach from previous literature, we propose an alternative approach for frame classification that requires no labeled data for training, namely prompt-engineering using GPT-3.5. The results show that fine-tuning with GPT-3.5 produces 72% accuracy (slightly higher than other smaller models), and that the promptengineering approach results in lower performance (49% accuracy.) Our analysis also shows that the subjectivity of the human labeling task has an effect on the obtained accufracy.\", \"The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss related work. In Section 3, we describe the news dataset. In Section 4, we describe the methodology for both human labeling and machine classification of news frames. We present and discuss results for RQ1 and RQ2 in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Finally, we provide conclusions in Section 7.\"]}, {\"header\": \"RELATED WORK\", \"paragraph\": [\"Framing has been a concept widely studied in journalism, with a definition that is rooted in the study of this domain [23]: \\\"To frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described. \\\"\", \"For frame recognition, there are two main approaches: the inductive approach [16], where one can extract the frames after reading the article, and the deductive approach [38], where a predefined list of frames exists and the goal is to interpret if any of them appears in the article. In the deductive case, there are generic frames and subject-specific frames, and the way to detect them typically involves reading and identifying one frame at a time, or through answers to yes/no questions that represent the frames. Semetko et al. [52] used 5 types of generic frames (attribution of responsibility, human interest, conflict, morality, and economic consequences) based on previous literature, and they defined a list of 20 yes/no questions to detect frames in articles. For instance, the questions about morality are the following: \\\"Does the story contain any moral message? Does the story make reference to morality, God, and other religious tenets? Does the story offer specific social prescriptions about how to behave?\\\", and so on for each of the frame types. This categorization of frames has been used in various topics such as climate change [18] [19], vaccine hesitance [13], or immigration [34].\", \"We now compare the two approaches on a common topic, such as Covid-19. Ebrahim et al. [21] followed an inductive approach in which the frames were not predefined but emerged from the text (e.g., deadly spread, stay home, what if, the cost of Covid-19) using headlines as the unit of analysis. In contrast, the deductive approach has studied very different labels. El-Behary et al. [22] followed the method of yes/no questions, but in addition to the 5 generic frames presented before, they also used blame frame and fear frame. Adiprasetio et al. [1] and Rodelo [50] used the 5 generic frames with yes/no questions, while Catal\\u00e1n-Matamoros et al. [14] used the 5 frames and read the headline and subheadline to decide the main frame. Table 1 summarizes some of the the existing approaches. This previous work showed how frame labels can be different, and also that frame analysis has been done at both headline and article levels. These two approaches (inductive and deductive) that originated in journalism have since been replicated in the computing literature.\", \"We decided to follow the deductive approach because a predefined list of frames allows to compare among topics, countries, previous literature, and also because they represent a fixed list of labels for machine classification models. Furthermore, the inductive approach tends to be more specific to a topic, and from the computing viewpoint, past work has tried to justify topic modeling as a technique to extract frames from articles.\", \"Yl\\u00e4-Antitila et al. [60] proposed topic modeling as a frame extraction technique. They argued that topics can be interpreted as frames if three requirements are met: frames are operationalized as connections between concepts; subject-specific data is selected; and topics are adequately validated as frames, for which they suggested a practical procedure. This approach was based on the choice of a specific topic (e.g., climate change) and the use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as a technique to extract a number of subtopics. In a second phase, a qualitative study of the top 10 words of each subtopic was performed, and the different subtopics were eliminated or grouped, reducing the number and establishing a tentative description. In a third phase, the top 10 articles belonging to that frame/topic were taken, and if the description of the topic fitted at least 8 of the 10 articles, that topic/frame remained. The frames found in this article were: green growth, emission cuts, negotiations and treaties, environmental risk, cost of carbon emissions, Chinese emissions, economics of energy production, climate change, environmental activism, North-South burden sharing, state leaders negotiating, and citizen participation.\", \"From Entman\'s definition of frame [23], it seems that the deductive approach is more refined than the inductive approach (which seems to resemble the detection of sub-themes.) For example, with regard to climate change, there are stories on how people have been affected by climate change from an emotional point of view, thus personalizing the problem. In this case, we could categorize the corresponding frame as human interest, as the writer of the article is selecting \\\"some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient\\\". The language subtleties with which news articles are presented cannot be captured with basic topic modeling.\", \"Isoaho et al. [30] held the position that while the benefits of scale and scope in topic modeling were clear, there were also a number of problems, namely that topic outputs do not correspond to the methodological definition of frames, and thus topic modeling remained an incomplete method for frame analysis. Topic modeling, in the practice of journalistic research, is a useful technique to deal with the large datasets that are available, yet is often not enough to do more thorough analyses [31]. In our work, we clearly notice that frame analysis is not topic modeling. For example, two documents could be about the same topic, say Covid-19 vaccination, but one article could emphasize the number of deaths after vaccination, while the other emphasized the role of the vaccine as a solution to the epidemic.\", \"We also consider that the larger the number of possible frame types, the more likely it is to end up doing topic modeling instead of frame analysis. Using a deductive approach, Dallas et al. [12] created a dataset with articles about polemic topics such as immigration, same sex marriage, or smoking, and they defined 15 types of frames: \\\"economic, capacity and resources, morality, fairness and equality, legality, constitutionality and jurisprudence, policy prescription and evaluation, crime and punishment, security and defense, health and safety, quality of life, cultural identity, political, external regulation and reputation, other\\\". In this case, they authors did not use a list of questions. Instead, for each article, annotators were asked to identify any of the 15 framing dimensions present in the article and to label text blurbs that cued them (based on the definitions of each of the frame dimensions) and decide the main frame of each article. In our case, we followed the idea of detecting the main frame by reading the text instead of answering questions, but instead of using the 15 frames proposed in [12] , we used the 5 generic frames proposed in [52].\", \"A final decision in our work was the type of text to analyze, whether headlines or whole article. For this decision, the chosen classification method was also going to be important. For example, Khanehzar et al. [33] used traditional approaches such as SVMs as baseline, and demonstrated the improvement in frame classification with the use of pre-trained languages models such as BERT, RoBERTa and XLNet, following a fine-tuning approach, setting as input text a maximum of 256 tokens (although the maximum number of input tokens in these models is 512 tokens.) Liu et al. [37] classified news headlines about the gun problem in the United States, arguing for the choice of headlines as a unit of analysis based on previous journalism literature [6], [44], that advocated for the importance and influence of headlines on readers and the subsequent perception of articles. From a computational viewpoint, using headlines is also an advantage, since you avoid the 512 token limitation in BERT-based models. Therefore, we decided to work with headlines about a controversial issue, namely the Covid-19 no-vax movement.\", \"Continuing with the question of the methods used for classification, much work has been developed in prompt engineering, especially since the release of GPT-3. Liu et al. [36] presented a good overview of the work done on this new NLP paradigm, not only explaining the concept of prompt engineering, but also the different strategies that can be followed both in the design of prompts, [12] 15 generic frames: \\\"Economic\\\", \\\"Capacity and resources\\\", \\\"Morality\\\", \\\"Fairness and equality\\\", \\\"Legality, constitutionality and jurisprudence\\\", \\\"Policy prescription and evaluation\\\", \\\"Crime and punishment\\\", \\\"Security and defense\\\", \\\"Health and safety\\\", \\\"Quality of life\\\", \\\"Cultural identity\\\", \\\"Public opinion\\\", \\\"Political\\\", \\\"External regulation and reputation\\\", \\\"Other\\\".\"]}, {\"header\": \"To label frames of full articles\", \"paragraph\": [\"Reading the full article, the annotator defines the main frame 20000 articles [33]  131 headlines + subheadlines the potential applications, and the challenges to face when using this approach. Prompt engineering applications include knowledge probing [46], information extraction [53], NLP reasoning [57], question answering [32], text generation [20], multi-modal learning [58], and text classification [24], the latter being the prompt-engineering use case in our work. Puri et al. [45] presented a very interesting idea that we apply to our classification task. This consists of providing the language model with natural language descriptions of classification tasks as input, and training it to generate the correct answer in natural language via a language modeling objective. It is a zero-shot learning approach, in which no examples are used to explain the task to the model. Radford et al. [48] demonstrated that language models can learn tasks without any explicit supervision. We have followed this approach to find an alternative way to do frame analysis.\", \"As mentioned before, the emergence of giant models like GPT-3, BLOOM, and ChatGPT are a very active research topic. To the best of our knowledge, on one hand our work extends the computational analysis of news related to the covid-19 no-vax movement, which illustrates the influence of the press on the ways societies think about relevant issues [40], [59], and on the other hand it adds to the literature of human-machine interaction, regarding the design of GPT-3 prompts for classification tasks [39], [2].\"]}, {\"header\": \"DATA: EUROPEAN COVID-19 NEWS DATASET\", \"paragraph\": [\"We used part of the European Covid-19 News dataset collected in our recent work [3].

The dataset was used for various analyses, such as name entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and subtopic modeling, to understand how Covid-19 vaccination was reported in Europe through the print media (in digital format.) The subtopic modeling analysis revealed a subsample of articles on the no-vax movement, which is the one we have used in this paper.

The codebook follows the proposed by [52] with 5 generic frames (attribution of responsibility, human interest, conflict, morality, and economic consequences) plus one additional \'no-frame\' category. Two researchers were engaged to annotate a sample of the collected newspaper articles following a three-phase training procedure.\", \"In the first phase, annotators had to read the codebook and get familiar with the task. In the second phase, they were asked to identify the main frame in the same subset of 50 headlines. At the end of the second phase, the intercoder reliability (ICR) was 0.58 between the 2 annotators. We analyzed those cases where there were discrepancies, and observed that in some cases, there was not a unique main frame, because both annotators had valid arguments to select one of the frames. In other cases, the discrepancies were due to slight misunderstanding of the definitions. In the third phase, the annotators coded again 50 headlines, and the ICR increased to was 0.66. We realized that the possibility of having two frames remained. They discussed the cases in which they had disagreed, and if the other person\'s arguments were considered valid, it could be said that there were two frames. After this three-phase training procedure, annotators were ready to annotate the dataset independently. We divided the dataset into two equal parts, and each person annotated 893 headlines.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Fine-tuning GPT-3.5 and BERT-based models\", \"paragraph\": [\"With the annotated dataset, we investigated two NLP approaches: the first one involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model; the second one is prompt engineering. Pre-trained language models have been In the first approach, a model with a fixed architecture is pretrained as a language model (LM), predicting the likelihood of the observed textual data. This can be done due to the availability of large, raw text data needed to train LMs. This learning process can produce general purpose features of the modeled language. The learning process produces robust, general-purpose features of the language being modeled. The above pre-trained LM is then adapted to different downstream tasks, by introducing additional parameters and adjusting them using task-specific objective functions. In this approach, the focus was primarily on goal engineering, designing the training targets used in both the pre-training and the fine-tuning stages [36].\", \"We present an example to illustrate the idea. Imagine that the task is sentiment analysis, and we have a dataset with sentences and their associated sentiment, and a pre-trained model, which is a saved neural network trained with a much larger dataset. For that pre-trained model to address the target task, we unfreeze a few of the top layers of the saved model base and jointly train both the newly-added classifier layers and the last layers of the base model. This allows to \\\"fine-tune\\\" the higher-order feature representations in the base model to make them more relevant for the sentiment analysis task. In this way, instead of having to obtain a very large dataset with target labels to train a model, we can reuse the pretrained model and use a much smaller train dataset. We use a part of our dataset as examples for the model to learn the task, while the other part of the dataset is used to evaluate model performance.\", \"Previous works related to frame classification in the computing literature have used fine-tuning, BERT-based models. In our work, we have done the same as a baseline, but we aimed to go one step further and also produce results using fine-tuning of GPT-3.5.\"]}, {\"header\": \"Prompt-engineering with GPT-3.5\", \"paragraph\": [\"Model fine-tuning has been widely used, but with the emergence of generative models such as GPT-3, another way to approach classification tasks has appeared. The idea is to use the pre-trained model directly and convert the task to be performed into a format as close as possible to the tasks for which it has been pre-trained. That is, if the model has been pre-trained from next word prediction as in the case of GPT-3, classification can be done by defining a prompt, where the input to the model is an incomplete sentence, and the model must complete it with a word or several words, just as it has been trained. This avoids having to use part of the already labeled dataset to teach the task to be performed to the model, and a previous labeling is not needed [36].\", \"In this approach, instead of adapting pre-trained LMs to downstream tasks via objective engineering, downstream tasks are reformulated to look more like those solved during the original LM training with the help of a textual prompt. For example, when recognizing the emotion of a social media post, \\\"I missed the bus today. \\\", we may continue with a prompt \\\"I felt so _\\\", and ask the LM to fill the blank with an emotion-bearing word. Or if we choose the prompt \\\"English: I missed the bus today. French: _\\\"), an LM may be able to fill in the blank with a French translation. In this way, by selecting the appropriate prompts, we can influence the model behavior so that the pre-trained LM itself can be used to predict the desired output, even without any additional task-specific training [36].\", \"We use this emerging NLP approach to classify frames at headline level. We are not aware of previous uses of this strategy to classify frames as we propose here. The idea is the following. Prompt engineering consists of giving a prompt to the model, and understands that prompt as an incomplete sentence. To do prompt engineering with our dataset, we needed to define an appropriate prompt that would produce the headline frames as output. We defined several experiments with the Playground of GPT-3, in order to find the best prompt for our task. In our initial experiments, we followed existing approaches in prompt engineering to do sentiment analysis, where the individual answer was an adjective, and this adjective was matched with a sentiment. In a similar fashion, we decided to build a thesaurus of adjectives that define each of the frames. For instance, the human interest frame could be \'interesting\', \'emotional\', \'personal\', \'human\'. The conflict frame could be: \'conflictive\', \'bellicose\', \'troublesome\', \'rowdy\', \'quarrelsome\', \'troublemaker\', \'agitator\', etc. After the list of adjectives was defined, we needed to define the prompt in order to get, as an answer, one of the adjectives in our thesaurus to match them with the frame. We used the GPT-3 playground using the headline as input and asking for the frame as output, but the strategy did not work. In our final experiment, instead of giving the headline as input, we gave the definitions of each type of frame plus the headline, and we asked the model to choose between the different types of frames as output. In this way, the output of the model was directly one of the frames, and we avoided the step of matching adjectives with frames. An example is shown in Figure 2. After testing with the GPT-3 playground and varying different hyper-parameters to assess performance, we set the temperature to 0, since the higher the temperature the more random the response. Furthermore, the Top-p parameter was set to 1, as it would likely get a set of the most likely words for the model to choose from. The maximum number of tokens was set to 2; in this way, the model is asked to choose between one of the responses. As a model, we used the one with the best performance at the time of experimental design, which was TEXT-DAVINCI-003, recognized as GPT 3.5.\"]}, {\"header\": \"RESULTS: HUMAN LABELING OF FRAMES IN NO-VAX NEWS HEADLINES (RQ1)\", \"paragraph\": [\"In this section, we present and discuss the results of the analysis related to our first RQ.

Human interest is the most predominant frame. Manual inspection shows that this is because the headlines are about personal cases of people who are pro-or anti-vaccine. Attribution of responsibility is also present. Manual inspection indicates that local politicians and health authorities had to make decisions about who could be vaccinated at the beginning of the process. The second peak at the end of summer 2021 coincided with the health pass (also called Covid passport in some countries), and we can observe a peak in the curve corresponding to the conflict frame, reflecting the demonstrations against the measure of mandatory health passes taken by country governments.\", \"In Figure 5, we compare the sentiment per frame and per country, to understand if there were any major differences.

Examining in more  Regarding the results of the annotation process, the fact that the distribution of the 6 frame types is relatively similar between countries suggests that the anti-vaccine movement issue was treated in a similar way in these countries. The fact that human interest is the most dominant frame indicates that this issue was treated from a more human and emotional approach, with headlines about personal experiences, celebrities giving their opinion about vaccination, and politicians defending vaccine policies. Moreover, the reason for many headlines being classified as no-frame is partly due to how data was selected. We chose articles that contained words related to no-vax, either in the headline or in the article. This resulted in many headlines not containing anything specific related to no-vax, while the no-vax content was actually included in the main text of the corresponding articles.\", \"It is worth mentioning that prior to obtaining the results, we had expected that attribution of responsibility would be among the most prominent frames, since governments took many measures such as mandatory health pass requirements to access certain sites; we had also expected that the conflict frame would be prominent, since there were many demonstrations in Europe.

Three models were used: GPT-3.5 and two BERTbased models. We observe that, on average, GPT-3.5 performs better than the BERT-based models. This is somehow expected as GPT-3.5 is a much larger model. Overall, in the case of fine-tuning, the best performance for the six-class frame classification task is 72% accuracy, which is promising, with an improvement over previous models based on BERT. Yet, it should be noted that the performance differences are modest (2% improvement between GPT-3.5 and RoBERTa). On the other hand, BERT is open-source, while GPT-3 has an economic cost as the use of the model is not free, which monetarily limits the number of experiments that can be performed with it, as well as the different configurations one can explore to improve performance. This is important because much of the improvement in performance requires empirical explorations of model parameters More specifically, the cost of an experiment for each of the folds has a cost of 4 dollars (at the time of writing this paper.) This represents a limitation in practice.\", \"Furthermore, GPT-3 has a significant carbon footprint. Similarly, for prompt engineering (discussed in the next subsection), choosing the right prompt (i.e., the words that best define the task so that the model is able to perform adequately) is also based on trial and error. This also has an impact on carbon footprint. In connection with this topic, Strubell et al. [55] argue that improvements in the accuracy of models depend on the availability of large computational resources, which involve large economic and environmental costs. A criticism has been made as \'the rich get richer\', in the sense that not all research groups have sufficient infrastructure resources and access to funding needed to use these models and improve their performance. Also in relation to this analysis, the work of Bender et al. [4] evaluates the costs and risks of the use of large language models, stating that researchers should be aware of the impact that these models have on the environment, and assess whether the benefits outweigh the risks. The work in [4] provides a very telling example, where people living in the Maldives or Sudan are affected by floods and pay the environmental price of training English LLMs, when similar models have not been produced for languages like Dhivehi or Sudanese Arab.

This observation, together with our previous experience in the annotation process, where headlines could have more than one valid frame, led us to design a second post-hoc experiment. We took all the headlines where each of the two annotators had disagreed with GPT-3.5, and we asked the annotators to state whether they would agree (or not) with each GPT-inferred label for a given headline. It is important to emphasize that the annotators did not know the origin of that label, i.e., they did not know if it was the label they had originally assigned, or if it was a random one. In this way, we could quantify how GPT-3.5 worked according to valid arguments provided by the annotators.

Much of what we do as people has a subjective component, influenced by how we feel or how we express opinions.\", \"News reading is never fully objective, and the annotators engaged in the frame classification task, influenced by their personal state of mind, experience, and culture, may perceive information differently. Monarch affirms that \\\"for simple tasks, like binary labels on objective tasks, the statistics are fairly straightforward to decide which is the \'correct\' label when different annotators disagree. But for subjective tasks, or even objective tasks with continuous data, there are no simple heuristics for deciding what the correct label should be\\\" [42].\", \"Subjectivity is involved in both the generation and perception of information: the assumption that there is only one frame is complicated by the point of view of the reader. In the case of news, the information sender (the journalist) has an intention, but the receiver (the reader) plays a role and is influenced by it. In psychology, this is known as the lens model of interpersonal communication, where the sender has certain objectives, but the receiver can interpret or re-interpret what the sender wants to say, with more or less accuracy [26].\", \"Following this discussion on subjectivity, the question arose as to what would happen if, instead of headlines, we used the complete article as a source of analysis.

After annotating the headlines, we found that of the 1786 headlines, the predominant frame is human interest (45.3% of cases), which presents a news item with an emotional angle, putting a face to a problem or situation. We also found that a substantial proportion of headlines were annotated as not presenting any frame (40.2% of cases).

These requests are increasingly important with the rise of natural language-based conversational interfaces for search and recommendation systems. However, NDR lacks abundant training data for models, and current platforms commonly do not support these requests. Fortunately, classical user-item interaction datasets contain rich textual data, e.g., reviews, which often describe user preferences and context -this may be used to bootstrap training for NDR models. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation to train NDR models. We use LLMs for authoring synthetic narrative queries from user-item interactions with fewshot prompting and train retrieval models for NDR on synthetic queries and user-item interaction data. Our experiments demonstrate that this is an effective strategy for training small-parameter retrieval models that outperform other retrieval and LLM baselines for narrative-driven recommendation.','[{\"header\": \"RELATED WORK\", \"paragraph\": [\"Data Augmentation for Information Access. A line of recent work has explored using language models to generate synthetic queries for data augmentation to train models for information retrieval tasks [7,8,15,23,31]. Here, given a document collection of interest, a pre-trained language model is used to create synthetic queries for the document collection. An optional filtering step excludes noisy queries, and finally, a bi-encoder or a cross-encoder is trained for the retrieval task. While earlier work of Ma et al. [31] train a custom query generation model on web-text datasets, more recent work has leveraged large language models for zero/few-shot question generation [7,8,15,23]. In generating synthetic queries, this work indicates the effectiveness of smaller parameter LLMs (up to 6B parameters) for generating synthetic queries in simpler information-retrieval tasks [7,8,23], and finds larger models (100B parameters and above) to be necessary for harder tasks such as argument retrieval [15,23]. Similar to this work, we explore the generation of synthetic queries with LLMs for a retrieval task. Unlike this work, we demonstrate a data augmentation method for creating effective training data from sets of user documents found in recommendation datasets rather than individual documents. Other work in this space has also explored training more efficient multivector models from synthetic queries instead of more expensive cross-encoder models [39] and generating queries with a diverse range of intents than the ones available in implicit feedback datasets to enhance item retrievability [35]. 3 https://github.com/iesl/narrative-driven-rec-mint/ Besides creating queries for ad-hoc retrieval tasks, concurrent work of Leszczynski et al. [25] has also explored the creation of synthetic conversational search datasets from music recommendation datasets with LLMs. The synthetic queries and user documents are then used to train bi-encoder retrieval models for conversational search. Our work resembles this in creating synthetic queries from sets of user items found in recommendation interaction datasets. However, it differs in the task of focus, creating long-form narrative queries for NDR. Finally, our work also builds on the recent perspective of Radlinski et al. [36] who make a case for natural language user profiles driving recommenders -narrative requests tie closely to natural language user profiles. Our work presents a step toward these systems.\", \"Finally, while our work explores data augmentation from useritem interactions for a retrieval-oriented NDR task, prior work has also explored data augmentation of the user-item graph for training collaborative filtering models. This work has often explored augmentation to improve recommendation performance for minority [12,47] or cold-start users [11,28,45]. And has leveraged generative models [11,45] and text similarity models [28] for augmenting the user-item graph.\", \"Complex Queries in Information Access. With the advent of performant models for text understanding, focus on complex and interactive information access tasks has seen a resurgence [2,29,32,48]. NDR presents an example of this -NDR was first formalized in Bogers and Koolen [5] for the case of book recommendation and subsequently studied in other domains [3,4,6]. Bogers and Koolen [5] systematically examined narrative requests posted by users on discussion forums. They defined NDR as a task requiring item recommendation based on a long-form narrative query and prior-user item interactions. While this formulation resembles personalized search [42] and query-driven recommendation [20], the length and complexity of requests differentiate these from NDR. Other work has also demonstrated the effectiveness of re-ranking initial recommendations from collaborative filtering approaches Figure 3: Mint re-purposes readily available user-item interaction datasets commonly used to train collaborative filtering models for narrative-driven recommendation. This is done by authoring narrative queries for sets of items liked by a user with a large language model. The data is filtered with a smaller language model and retrieval models are trained on the synthetic queries and user items.\", \"based on the narrative query [18]. More recent work of Afzali et al. [1] formulate the NDR task without access to the prior interactions of a user while also noting the value of contextual cues contained in the narrative request. In our work, we focus on this latter formulation of NDR, given the lack of focus on effectively using the rich narrative queries in most prior work. Further, we demonstrate the usefulness of data augmentation from LLMs and user-item interaction datasets lacking narrative queries.\", \"Besides this, a range of work has explored more complex, longform, and interactive query formulations for information access; these resemble queries in NDR. Arguello et al. [2] define the tip of tongue retrieval task, a known-item search task where user queries describe the rich context of items while being unable to recall item metadata itself. Mysore et al. [32] formulate an aspect conditional query-by example task where results must match specific aspects of a long natural language query.

Mint re-purposes historical user-item interaction datasets for NDR by using a 175B parameter large language model to author long-form narrative queries while conditioning on the text of items liked by users. We evaluate bi-encoder and cross-encoder models trained on data from Mint on the publicly available Pointrec test collection for narrative-driven point of interest recommendation. We demonstrate that the resulting models outperform several strong baselines and ablated models and match or outperform a 175B LLM directly used for NDR in a 1-shot setup.\", \"However, Mint also presents some limitations. Given our use of historical interaction datasets for generating synthetic training data and the prevalence of popular interests in these datasets longer, tailed interests are unlikely to be present in the generated synthetic datasets. In turn, causing retrieval models to likely see poorer performance on these requests. Our use of LLMs to generate synthetic queries also causes the queries to be repetitive in structure, likely causing novel longer-tail queries to be poorly served. These limitations may be addressed in future work. Besides this, other avenues also present rich future work. While Mint leverages a 175B LLM for generating synthetic queries, smaller parameter LLMs may be explored for this purpose -perhaps by training dedicated QGen models. Mint may also be expanded to explore more active strategies for sampling items and users for whom narrative queries are authored -this may allow more efficient use of large parameter LLMs while ensuring higher quality training datasets. Next, the generation of synthetic queries from sets of documents may be explored for a broader range of retrieval tasks beyond NDR given its promise to generate larger training sets -a currently underexplored direction. Finally, given the lack of larger-scale test collections for NDR and the effectiveness of LLMs for authoring narrative queries from user-item interaction, fruitful future work may also explore the creation of larger-scale datasets in a mixed-initiative setup to robustly evaluate models for NDR.\"]}, {\"header\": \"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\", \"paragraph\": [\"We thank anonymous reviewers for their invaluable feedback.

Although the general concept of OSM does not prescribe specific sets of views, a concrete OSM environment has to be specific about the particular views to be used in a particular project. At the University of Mannheim we are developing a prototype OSM environment, nAOMi, that supports the views defined by the KobrA 2.0 method, a version of KobrA adapted for OSM. In this paper we provide an overview of the KobrA 2.0 metamodel underpinning nAOMi and give a small example of its use to model a software system.','[{\"header\": \"INTRODUCTION\", \"paragraph\": [\"Orthographic Software Modeling (OSM) is based on three fundamental hypotheses -(a) that it is feasible to integrate the many different kinds of artifacts used in contemporary software engineering methods within a single coherent methodology in which they are treated as views, (b) that it is feasible to create an efficient and scalable way of supporting these views by generating them dynamically, on-the-fly, from a Single Underlying Model (SUM) using model-based transformations and (c) that it is feasible to provide an intuitive metaphor for navigating around these many views by adapting the orthographic projection technique underpinning the CAD tools used in other engineering disciplines. As shown in Figure 1, the main advantages of using the idea of orthographic projection to define the views used to visualize and described a system are that they (a) can be organized according to a simple and easy-to-understand metaphor and (b) collectively represent all the properties of a system with minimal overlap and redundancy. In practice this translates into a set of \\\"dimensions\\\", each containing well defined choices (or so called \\\"dimension elements\\\") that can be used to select individuals views.\", \"As shown in Figure 2, the main advantage of making the artifacts used to describe a software system views of a SUM is that the number of pairwise coherence relationships that have to be maintained is reduced and new views can be introduced by simply defining their relationship to the SUM. Moreover, the importance of this advantage grows quickly as the size of the system and the complexity of the deployed development methodology increase. Another important advantage is that the dominance of one particular kind of view over the development process (e.g. code) at the expense of other kinds of views (e.g. graphical models) is reduced so that any appropriate type of views can be used to enrich the underlying description of the system, depending on the needs and skills of the stakeholder involved. This makes it possible to subsume all view types under the same, overarch-SUM SUM / View Centric Environment Artifact / Tools Centric Environment ing development process and methodology (e.g. agile-driven, focusing on small development cycles, or model-driven development, based on transformations between abstraction levels). Although the details of how the views are created from the SUM and how the SUM is updated from the views are not central to the approach, a natural implementation is to use the visualization and transformation technologies offered by model driven software engineering (MDSE).\", \"To explore the validity of these hypotheses at the University of Mannheim we have been developing a prototype OSM modeling environment based on an enhanced version of the KobrA method for model-driven, component-oriented development, KobrA 2.0 [1]. This was chosen as a basis for the prototype, known as the Open, Adaptable, Orthographic Modeling Environment (nAOMi) [13] because its views were designed with the precise goals of being (a) genuine projections of a subject containing carefully selected subsets of information about that subject, (b) minimalistic in the sense that they should overlap to the smallest extent possible and contain the minimum necessary models elements, and (c) selectable via a set of independent \\\"dimensions\\\" which reflect different fundamental concerns of development (i.e. abstraction levels, composition or variants). In other words, KobrA already provided one of the \\\"most orthogonal\\\" sets of views for visualizing software systems of any contemporary method. More details about the actual views and dimensions defined in KobrA are presented in the following sections. More information on OSM can be found in [2] and [3].\", \"nAOMi is implemented as an Eclipse plugin using the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) as the underlying modeling platform and UML 2.0 tools [4] to generate and edit views. The KobrA 2.0 metamodel on which the current version of nAOMi is based is a specialization of the UML metamodel composed of three separate packages -one for the SUM, one for the views and one for the transformations (Figure 3). The UML was chosen as the base language because of its maturity and widespread acceptance, making the environment usable to the largest possible body of developers. UML elements not needed in KobrA 2.0 are excluded using OCL constraints while new elements or properties are introduced by specializing existing elements.\", \"The unique contribution of this paper is to elaborate on the structure of the KobrA 2.0 metamodel and how it is used to drive nAOMi. The three following sections each focus on one of the three main components of the metamodel -the SUM, the views and the transformations . This is followed by a brief overview of the OSM navigation paradigm in Section 5 before a small example of the approach is presented in Section 6. Section 7 then concludes the paper with related and future work.\"]}, {\"header\": \"SUM PACKAGE\", \"paragraph\": [\"Figure 4 depicts the internal structure of the SUM package which is based on the UML metamodel. There are three main subpackages, two containing the structural and behavioral constructs respectively, and one containing the constraints that ensure that the metaclasses are used according to the KobrA conventions and rules.\", \"The Classes subpackage of the Structure package contains some of the most fundamental elements of the KobrA metamodel, such as Class and ComponentClass. The internal structure of this package is illustrated in Figure 5. Com-ponentClass represents objects with complex and reusable behaviors, while Class captures simple \\\"data type\\\" objects that have only very simple or non-reusable behaviors. The modeler has to decide whether it is necessary to model a specific part of the system as a ComponentClass and include state charts and activity diagrams, or whether it is sufficient to use a Class (which is limited to using OCL constraints).\", \"ComponentClass inherits (indirectly via Class) from Communications so it also has the isActive attribute. This makes it possible to model whether its instances are active or passive. Active objects, which can be used to model threads and processes ([8] p. 438), start to execute their behavior as soon as they are created and perform operations spontaneously.\", \"A ComponentClass may exhibit complex behavior. In Ko-brA, this behavior may be specified in the form of UML State Diagrams (defining acceptable operation invocation sequences), and in the form of Activities (defining algorithms of operations). UML Interaction elements (in sequence diagrams) can be derived from the activity elements and thus are not included in the SUM. As KobrA aims to facilitate automatic checking of allowed sequences of operation calls, Protocol State Machines are supported instead of general state machines. Since the latter include a large variety of elements not needed for specifying acceptable operation se-quences or automatic checking, OCL constraints are used to prohibit the use of unwanted features. For example, since KobrA has no concept of roles for components, the use of role also needs to be prohibited. The part association refers to owned properties of components whose attribute isComposite is true. As KobrA uses associations like nests and creates for components, part, required and provided are not needed. Connectors (i.e. delegation and assembly) are not used in KobrA either so ownedConnector is excluded.\"]}, {\"header\": \"VIEWS PACKAGE\", \"paragraph\": [\"The structure of the Views package is illustrated in Figure 6. Again, since most of the views defined in KobrA 2.0 are based on UML diagrams, the view metamodels have similar elements to the SUM metamodel. The big difference to the SUM is that there are no restrictions on the use of the view metamodel elements. For instance, views for a particular purpose such as supporting model checkers can be supported by adding elements unrelated to the UML.\", \"The substructure of the Views package reflects the types and organization of the KobrA views according to the view \\\"dimensions\\\" supported in nAOMi (cf. example in Section 6). At the top level, the Views package is thus decomposed into the Specification and Realization options of the encapsulation dimension. These, in turn are both decomposed into the Structural, Behavioral and Operational options of the Projection dimension. Finally, with the exception of the behavioral option, these are also all subdivided into the Service and Type options of the granularity dimension. This dimension, with its two options, is an addition to the original version of KobrA.\", \"The Service view shows the direct, publicly visible relationships of the subject ComponentClass to other Compo-nentClasses, while the Type view shows the publicly visible relationships of the subject to simple Classes. As with the SUM, constraints have been defined to control what can go into each view and when they are well formed. For every view, a constraint enumerates all allowed elements (not shown in this paper).\", \"In the following, some of the other constraints for the Service view are elaborated. Since this view is a black-box view, the internals of ComponentClasses (nestedClassifier ) are not shown.\", \"context ComponentClass --no nested classifiers , no protocol inv : nestedClassifier -> union ( protocol ) -> isEmpty () Classes are only allowed if they are generalizations of Com-ponentClasses, (or any of its superclasses, since a Compo-nentClass may inherit from a class as shown in the constraints with context Class. The following invariants ensure that only publicly visible attributes and operations are in this view, for both classes and ComponentClasses (which inherit from Class). Only operation signatures are shown in this view, so pre-, post-and bodyconditions, as well as activities are omitted, which is reflected in the last constraint.\", \"context Operation --only the signature of the Operation is shown , not its behavior ( role name \\\" method \\\" refers to the Activities of the operation ) , or dependencies inv : method -> union ( precondition ) -> union ( body ) -> union ( postcondition ) -> isEmpty ()\"]}, {\"header\": \"TRANSFORMATIONS PACKAGE\", \"paragraph\": [\"The package AllViews provides the foundation for specifying the transformations between the SUM and the views in both directions. Part of the package\'s contents are shown in Figure 7. The Abstraction concept (which is in fact a dependency reused from the UML but with additional constraints) plays the key role in relating elements from the SUM to elements of a view. Abstraction is actually mapped to ExpressionInOcl. When appearing in transformations, the equals sign links elements in the SUM to the respective elements in the view, and vice versa. For instance, equality of the general meta-association of a Generalization in a transformation invariant means that, when following general, there must be an element in the SUM and in the view for which similar transformation expressions are specified.\", \"In the case of KobrA 2.0, which has many projections that just select a subset of elements using one-to-one abstractions, this allows concise declarative TransformationExpressions. Together with the view constraints, a CASE tool can be implemented which uses a transformation language of the implementor\'s choice, for instance the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) [11] or QVT [9]. The role names se and ve are short for SumElement and ViewElement, respectively. These roles subset the client and supplier roles from the UML. SUM elements are translated into UML elements with stereotypes, so that the views are easy to manage for developers familiar with the UML. The bidirectional mappings between stereotyped view elements and non-stereotyped SUM elements are expressed in the constraints of the Association-Abstraction, a subclass of the Abstraction from the AllViews package. This is also an example of a transformation which is reused in other views. Figure 8 shows the main elements involved in the transformation of the black box structural view for Component-Classes. The first transformation constraint is on the view and declares the starting point for the transformation. It states that the subject ComponentClass and its generalizations (using a SUM utility function, superClosure) are in the view.\", \"The following transformation rules illustrate how to create the output (i.e. view) elements from the input (i.e. SUM) elements, such as the publicly visible attributes and operations of the ComponentClass and the acquired ComponentClasses. The first constraint for ComponentClassAbstraction states that references to potential general classes (and Component-Classes) of ComponentClasses are mirrored in the view. In addition, ComponentClasses will be shown with the corresponding stereotypes. The ComponentClass owns various types of associations, so in this view only the acquires associations are selected (whose transformation rules are covered in the common transformation packages).For classes and ComponentClasses, only publicly visible attributes and operations appear in the view. Class invariants are also copied. Classes that may appear in this view (e.g. as generalizations of ComponentClasses) may have a powertype (role name powertypeExtent) which will be displayed.\", \"The last transformation statement copies the class references of operations. As with all views, the transformation rules, the common transformation statements (which also cover operations) and the view constraints serve as a specification for the implementation of a view. Individual CASE tools can use different implementation techniques as long as they conform to the semantics of these rules and constraints.  For the black box type view, only publicly visible attributes and operations of classes (as opposed to Compo-nentClasses) used by the subject can be seen. This is specified in the first rule which defines owned members of the view and thus serves as the starting point of the transformation. cbbTypes is a utility function defined in the SUM which computes the black box types by selecting the types of the subject\'s public attributes and parameter types of its public operations.\", \"Class invariants and potential powertypes and connections to the classes in this view are shown as well. There may also be Enumerations, for which the EnumerationLiterals are displayed.\", \"The transformation rules for this view are almost the same as the realization transformation constraints from the package Transformation::Realization::Structural::Class::Type. The differences are the select(visibility=#public) statements for operations and attributes. s t r i n g I n S i g n a t u r e\"]}, {\"header\": \"NAVIGATION\", \"paragraph\": [\"Most of today\'s tools use some combination of trees to organize the content of models as well as the views used to visualize a software system or component. In an any environment incorporating a number of different tools there is invariably a large number of different trees storing a heterogeneous mix of artifacts including model elements (e.g. classes, instances, associations), diagrams (e.g. class diagrams, state diagrams) and other artifact types (source code, XML files, configuration files ). To work with all the views in a traditional development environment, therefore, engineers typically have to learn about the organization structures of all the incorporated tools.\", \"In contrast to conventional paradigms for organizing and navigating the many views used to visualize a system, OSM employs the metaphor of a multi-dimensional cube. More specifically, as illustrated in Figure 9, OSM regards dimension of the underlying methodology as representing a different dimension of the cube, and each independently variable aspect of that dimension is a selectable dimension element. Selecting a view thus simply corresponds to selecting a single cell within the cube. In general, three types of dimensions are supported: static dimensions in which the number of selectable elements (i.e. coordinates) is fixed, dynamic dimensions in which the number of elements is dynamic (i.e. derived from the SUM), and mixed dimensions which have both static and dynamic elements.\", \"To support the OSM dimension based navigation metaphor for KobrA, we defined the seven dimensions indicated on the left hand side of Figure 10 which is a sceenshot of nAOMI. The Abstraction dimension (not expanded here), which has three static dimension elements, PIM (platform independent model), PSM (platform specific model) and Code, captures the model-driven development concern of KobrA. The version dimension captures the state of the modeled system at specific points in time. The Component dimension, which has dynamic dimension elements defined by instances of the class ComponentClass in the SUM, captures the componentbased development concern of KobrA.\", \"The Encapsulation dimension, which has two fixed elements, supports the distinction between Specification (black box) and Realization (white box) views of components, while the Projection dimension with the fixed elements Structural, Operational and Behavioral covers the different information types. The Granularity dimension provides a finer grained distinction between views describing the types used by components (Type granularity) and views describing the required and provided interfaces (Service granularity). The Operation dimension allows a selection of individual operations.\", \"In the ideal case, when all views are truly orthogonal, the choices that can be made in each dimensions are completely independent. However, this is very difficult to achieve in software engineering. The approach still works if the views are not completely orthogonal, but dependencies then occur between different choices in different dimensions, so that the decisions made in one dimensions may affect choices possible in another dimension. This is best handled by giving dimensions a precedence ranking determined by the order in which they appear (the top being the highest). When an element in a dimension is selected, the tool automatically makes default selections for dimensions of lower precedence (i.e. dimensions lower down) and disables selections that would navigate to cells (i.e. views) which are not (yet) defined by the method at hand.\"]}, {\"header\": \"SHOPPING CART EXAMPLE\", \"paragraph\": [\"To show how a software system can be specified using nAOMi, this section presents a case study based on a shopping cart system. A ShoppingCart component collects and manages the products selected by users and supports payment via a credit card. Figure 10 illustrates a structural view of the component.\", \"In the dimension navigator on the left hand side, PIM was chosen for the \\\"Abstraction Level\\\" (not expanded in the screenshot). The second dimension is the state of the software system at a certain point in time. The picture shows that the latest available version was chosen. As with every choice in a dimension, it may influence the options in lower ranked dimensions. The component under consideration is the ShoppingCart, for which a black box view is selected in the next dimension. After the user selects the structural projection option and the service level granularity, the tool automatically chooses the option for all operations in the last dimension, as there is no editor registered for the other options.\", \"The component under development is presented with the stereotype subject and its relationship to other components and classes is shown in the view, which corresponds to a cell of the multi-dimensional navigation cube, and is generated on-the-fly from the SUM when it is selected. The classes Product and CreditCard can be used as data types in the operations of the component.\", \"Figure 11 illustrates the operational view in which an operation can be formalized using pre-and postconditions. The precondition corresponds to the assumes clause in and the postcondition corresponds to the result clause. As in the UML, the precondition of an operation must be true when the operation is invoked and the postcondition must be true when the operation is finished. The operation addProduct in Figure 11 must be in state CollectingProducts or Empty when invoked. This is also visible in the behavioral view, since there are only two transitions with the operation ad-dProduct. Both leads to the state CollectingProducts which is also a postcondition of the operation. The second postcondition is that the cost attribute of the component must be increased by the price of the added product. The pre-and postcondition can be expressed using the OCL. The properties of the component, states and operation parameters can be used to formalise the constraints like as in this example.\", \"Figure 12 shows the publicly visible behaviour of the Shop-pingCart component with states and transitions. The conditional transitions map to operations of the component. Like every view, this view is also synchronized with the SUM so that it is guaranteed that its operations, states and properties are consistent with those in the structural view. Although the operational view seems to be similar to the behavioral view because of the overlapping information within them, there are significant differences. The focus of the operational view is on a precise formal definition of an operation of a component. The operations can be enriched by preand postconditions which can be defined using complex OCL statements, that formalize the complete behavior of an operation. The additional information in the OCL statements can be used for code generation and documentation.\"]}, {\"header\": \"CONCLUSION\", \"paragraph\": [\"At the beginning of the paper we identified three fundamental hypothesis upon which the notion of OSM is based -(a) that it is feasible to integrate the many different kinds of artifacts used in contemporary software engineering methods within a single coherent methodology in which they are treated as views, (b) that it is feasible to create an efficient and scalable way of supporting these views by generating them dynamically, on-the-fly, from a Single Underlying Model (SUM) using model-based transformations and (c) that it is feasible to provide an intuitive metaphor for navigating around these many views by adapting the orthographic projection technique underpinning the CAD tools used in other engineering disciplines.\", \"The prototype tool, nAOMi, described in this paper represents the first step towards demonstrating the validity of these hypotheses and showing that OSM is a viable approach to software engineering. Of the three hypotheses, (a) and (c) are most convincingly demonstrated by the prototype, since it shows that it is indeed possible to support all the views of the KobrA method within a single navigation metaphor. The prototype tool does not demonstrate the validity of hypothesis (b) to the same extent as the others due to its small size. Although it demonstrates the feasibility of generating views from the SUM and vice-versa, the question of whether such an approach scales up to large environments is still open.\", \"Although nOAMi is the only tool developed with the specific aim of supporting KobrA-based OSM, several other tools and methods have similar properties or aims. For example, Glinz et al. [10] describe a tool with a fisheye zooming algorithm which lets the user view a model with varying amounts of detail depending on the context. It has to be investigated whether it is possible to combine the fisheye zooming concept with the dimension-based navigation paradigm. While the KobrA 2.0 implementation of nAOMi heavily uses UML diagrams for developers, Glinz et al. use custom diagram types, e.g. for structural and behavioral views.\", \"An approach which also emphasizes the description of formal consistency rules (correspondences) between views is RM-ODP [5][6]. However, this approach does not explicitly mention the notion of a SUM and thus implies that consistency rules should be defined in a pairwise fashion between individual pairs of views. ArchiMate [7], which complements TOGAF [12], is an enterprise architecture modeling language which offers two orthogonal \\\"dimensions\\\" for modeling, (business, architecture, and technology) layers and (informational, behavioral and structural ) aspects and also suggests two more dimensions, purpose and abstraction level. However, as many of these views span multiple choices of a single \\\"dimension\\\", the intuitive dimension-based navigation metaphor of OSM can not be easily applied. There are also more general approaches for view-based modeling but they are less specific in terms of consistency rules between views and provide little guidance on how to manage and navigate views, for example the Zachman Framework [14].\", \"Regarding the practical use of OSM environments in the future, the biggest challenge is developing appropriate SUM metamodels which can accommodate all the types of views and services that software engineers are accustomed to today. For this first prototypical SUM-based environment supporting the OSM approach we had a method at our disposal (KobrA) that already defined a full set of orthogonal UMLbased views. This allowed us to model the required SUM and view metamodels by simply adapting the UML metamodels, removing and adding model elements as needed.\", \"In doing so we were able to manually ensure that the metamodels fulfilled the two core requirements of SUM-based environments -(1) being minimalistic and (2) redundancy free. If SUM-based software engineering environments are to take off, and to be introduced into existing, heterogeneous environments, more sophisticated ways of integrating existing metamodels into a single unified metamodel will be required.\"]}]','https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1TBscbQ9zMU4S6Qg_AihU9wCzy58aVD6d&export=download',NULL,0,'2024-02-05 13:10:29.977888','2024-02-05 13:10:31.510224');
